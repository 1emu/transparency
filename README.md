# DAO Transparency

The goal is to make Decentraland's data more accesible, in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FoV7TdMTVnqVOZoV4bvVdHWkeu4sMH5JEhp8L0Shjlo/edit#gid=0).

Data is updated every day thanks to [Github Actions](https://github.com/Decentraland-DAO/transparency/actions).

### Design Principles
- Simplicity: Keep the dependencies to the minimum.
- Auditable: Open source code and public workflow logs.
- Accessible: Publish the data in many formats.
