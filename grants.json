Building the Statue of Love can make the spot (where it will be located) more unique and notable. It can turn into an interesting meeting spot that attracts more people to Decentraland.\n2.  It can create a buzz in the media :) like \"Decentraland has got its own statue of love! What's next??\" or something like that.\n3.  This statue has a good story behind it. This will be a statue of Mikasa Ackerman (from the Attack on Titan anime TV series). Please read the story down below.\n4.  Due to the fact that the statue is related to the Attack on Titan anime series, and I believe, has an impactful and emotional story behind it, it can attract the audience of the Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) TV series, which currently is THE most popular anime in the world with millions of people in its fandom. Also, the timing is just right, because for the time being the long-anticipated season 4 of AoT is finally on air.\n\nTHE SHORT STORY BEHIND THE STATUE\n(spoiler alert)\n\nMikasa Ackerman is sitting next to Eren's grave while wearing the precious red scarf that Eren once gave her. This is the final scene of Attack on Titan manga, Chapter 139, where Eren after his death came in the incarnation of a bird and wrapped the scarf around Mikasa as he promised.\n\n\"I will wrap that scarf around you as many times as you want, now and forever\".\n\n*   Eren to Mikasa.\n\nHOW I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA\n\nThis statue was my first personal project that I never finished till the end. I had an idea of making a 3d printable miniature for sale out of it and I even placed some work-in-progress images of it on my IG back in late May of 2021.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIuFxDD3aF/\nBut since June 2021 I was very busy with my freelancing projects so I never had a chance to actually finish the statue and offer it for sale. So in this regard, it's a unique piece of work and was never sold to anyone.\n\nThus, here I am with my model of Statue of Love and I'd like it to be my dent in the universe of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis work is 90% finished, but I want to take 3 weeks to polish it and give it a more finished look.\n\nYou can check the work-in-progress images with the current look of the statue in my Google Drive that I created especially for you guys\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X-xNmYEPM5-RmUSQMF37pOjz6AYnaXpl?usp=sharing\n\nIf you're interested to check some of my works, please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI will be working on this project alone. To judge about my skills and experience please visit my Artstation\nhttps://www.artstation.com/deniz_kudayar\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe model of the statue is 90% finished in regards to the modeling.\n\nI just need some polishing to do, to give it a more pleasing and finished look.\\\nThis project will take me 3 weeks maximum.

Just like in the analog world we create art and add it to our skin in a way that lasts forever, we'd like to make it possible for avatars also to have this means of expression.  We believe tattoos are a powerful means of expressing oneself -- as a snapshot of a moment in time, an important feeling, in memory of something, as a reminder, or just for fun. We have an amazing team of skilled developers, VR artists, marketers, and a large collective of analog tattoo artists who will contribute their unique tattoo styles to this project.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n50,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xCEC89Fd1738fa6AB7C90fDD2Fde18d8eb5dE9779\n\n## Description\n\nTaking analog artists in the tattoo world and helping them have their first experience with the metaverse, NFTs, and Web3 is a passion project we are excited to bring to fruition. It's one of the areas we think is most interesting since many of these artists have yet to enter this space and create tattoos that can be used in the metaverse. We believe that we can empower this unique group of physical artists to enter this area and support them by transforming their craft into something that can be used on virtual avatars. For Decentraland users, this will create a new layer/way for them to express themselves -- just like we do in the real world. It will make avatars stand out and be themselves (or whoever who they'd like to be). As another layer of expression, this will differentiate Decentraland from other platforms and allow for further self-expression for users of the metaverse.\n\nWe know that the time is now:\n\n1.  To create an easy process to allow physical tattoo artists to break into Web3 and the metaverse via the Decentraland platform\n2.  To support these artists in this new realm and make it easy for them to convert their craft to something that fits Decentraland's avatars\n3.  To build out a method to add the relevant normal maps and technological specifications to make tattoos visually appealing in Decentraland\n4.  To give users the opportunity to further express themselves in Decentraland with tattoos just like they do in the physical world\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs a new project we are currently in the researching stage. Our team has VR artists and developers who are passionate about making our concept a reality. We already have a group of tattoo artists who are working on their unique art for this project and our VR team will be transforming their art into VR versions ready to be implemented on avatars in Decentraland. The development team is ready to work with Decentraland to find the best technological solution for how we can integrate into your platform and provide added value to your users.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe're a team of established professionals around the world with experience in various industries and professions. We've come together to devote our collective energy to this project and are excited to take this step with Decentraland to make our vision happen.\nSara - Startup founder, Strategist and Organizational Consultant who is leading the team and our collective vision for the project.\nAmit - Analyst, Marketer and Tattoo enthusiast who is leading the artist collective and bringing in talented tattoo artists from around the world to join our DAO and cause.\nMarielle - AR/VR digital designer and classically trained artist using her creativity to help each artists transform their work for the best visual experience in the metaverse.\nVlad - Graphic designer and artist who is leading our brand and visual identity.\nNik + Mike - our software development team who is leading the smart contract development and integrative code that will allow us to flawlessly work with Decentraland\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nTeam building - by March 1\n\\-We will expand our team to add additional designers, marketers, and community managers to help grow our following and prepare for our launch.\nTattoo Collective Art Development - by March 20\n\\-Our tattoo artists collective is working on their art to be part of the initial collection.\nVR Art Creation - by April 10\n\\-We will adapt our artists artwork to fit the avatars in Decentraland to provide the best virtual look and feel for each tattoo.\nDevelopment for platform integration - by May 1\n\\-Our development team will develop and execute on our integration into the Decentraland platform.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=8d78d820-8849-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":14160754,"end":1645470600,"start":1644261000,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xcfc2ecfa09afb6cabe832aaec5e7590ef8ee06fdb4cfefec366093ca23a515d0699cc860861f821c00fb637e9fed10b19b5e4f68bb7d8be2535b86bf79a553101c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":24284,"discourse_topic_id":7680,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmtetpn-tattoos-for-decentraland-avatars","user":"0xcec89fd1738fa6ab7c90fdd2fde18d8eb5de9779","type":"grant","status":"active","title":"Tattoos for Decentraland Avatars","description":"Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nOur project creates a new way for avatars to express themselves and customize their avatars using tattoos.

We believe that we can empower this unique group of physical artists to enter this area and support them by transforming their craft into something that can be used on virtual avatars. For Decentraland users, this will create a new layer/way for them to express themselves -- just like we do in the real world. It will make avatars stand out and be themselves (or whoever who they'd like to be). As another layer of expression, this will differentiate Decentraland from other platforms and allow for further self-expression for users of the metaverse.\n\nWe know that the time is now:\n\n1.  To create an easy process to allow physical tattoo artists to break into Web3 and the metaverse via the Decentraland platform\n2.  To support these artists in this new realm and make it easy for them to convert their craft to something that fits Decentraland's avatars\n3.  To build out a method to add the relevant normal maps and technological specifications to make tattoos visually appealing in Decentraland\n4.  To give users the opportunity to further express themselves in Decentraland with tattoos just like they do in the physical world\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAs a new project we are currently in the researching stage. Our team has VR artists and developers who are passionate about making our concept a reality. We already have a group of tattoo artists who are working on their unique art for this project and our VR team will be transforming their art into VR versions ready to be implemented on avatars in Decentraland. The development team is ready to work with Decentraland to find the best technological solution for how we can integrate into your platform and provide added value to your users.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe're a team of established professionals around the world with experience in various industries and professions.

I am a recent graduate from fashion school and have taught myself how to use Blender to create wearables just for Decentraland. My goal for this project is to not only create inclusive clothing items but to give back to Decentraland by continuing to create unique and desirable clothing items.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4B75968043b77e01488ac98DA5d99Ebb0C2c73fe\n\n## Description\n\nI am a newer user to Decentraland and while I have greatly enjoyed it so far, I quickly noticed that the current clothing available lacks inclusivity and uniqueness. I have created a gender neutral clothing line that everyone will be able to wear and enjoy. This clothing line will bring a new standard for inclusivity to Decentraland.\n\nThis clothing line is based off of everyday street wear that still has uniqueness and creativity. The pieces are trendy, fashionable and the people wearing them will be proud to walk around and show them off. I am passionate about fashion and I am exciting to see how fashion is going to evolve in Decentraland. It is something that I greatly wish to be a part of and want to continue to release new pieces on a regular basis.\n\nAs a recent fashion grad, I want to use the skills that I have learned in a project that I really care about, like Decentraland. I believe that our future lies in the virtual world and Decentraland is at the forefront of this with their current product. With my background in fashion and schooling during this time of technological advancement, this something that I really wish to become a part of. The only component that I am lacking in my vision is the funding to make this possible.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis project is 100% complete and has been uploaded and tested in Decentraland builder. I used the wearable reference models available in Google Drive to create these pieces. I have spent countless hours teaching myself Blender to create quality pieces. I have also created all of the social media pages related to this project and have begun growing a community that supports my vision.\n\nThis is a link to two examples that I have created: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yhYg-qC6YkMTWMNzzoAf5zU7pzWGKBo7?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMyself - I need help!\n\nI have taken this head on by doing my own research, learning from videos, and a lot of trial and error until I figured things out. I am passionate about fashion and want to make my footprint in the Decentraland fashion world. I have a degree from fashion school and I spend a lot of time keeping up with the current trends. Technology has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember and I am quick to pick up on how to use various platforms and softwares. I also have a degree in marketing and business administration which provides me with the knowledge on how to grow my community as well as manage the business aspect of this project. With all of this combined, I am confident in saying that this collection will be a success and I will be able to use profits from this collection towards future collections in order to keep up with the growth of Decentraland.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWeek 1-2 : Marketing: includes gaining a following and building hype around the launch date of my clothing line through Discord, Twitter, Instagram, and promotion from other content creators\n\nWeek 3-4 : Post collection for approval, continue to drop sneak peaks of the collection, and get people hype to make their purchases\n\nWeek 5: Throw parties in Decentraland where people will gather and show off their new outfits. More promotional actions will be taken during these parties to make people excited for the next time I drop a new clothing line.  I plan to have frequent fashion shows.\n\nI will do giveaways throughout this process to people who support me and are looking forward to my future collections.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/s4gFZTR35D\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/denidnft\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/denidnft\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=65647d80-83d5-11ec-bd91-0316d7e70123)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":14124124,"end":1644376080,"start":1643771280,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x87c7bbbdeafc8ffa712d4131c22a81dcff7cb7fe8d1cba18fabe4aa7c9aaf8d1078214e5c5146bbb9afce24249bfda814fce4100e0df4275351f4758b8bfd6a41b","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":22626,"discourse_topic_id":7302,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmxg2rv-fashion-school-graduate-makes-wearables","user":"0x4b75968043b77e01488ac98da5d99ebb0c2c73fe","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Fashion School Graduate Makes Wearables","description":"Should the following Tier 2: up to $3,000 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI have created a set of clothing items that include matching sweatshirt, sweatpants, bucket hat and shoes in a variety of different colors.

We can build whatever we want on Decentraland. I want to share that with others and help Decentraland grow!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC9EA520f77CecDEF90B47A8DAdD739bbeA4d73cb\n\n## Description\n\nThis project deserves funding because I intend to educate the average person how beneficial it would be to start investing in Crypto Real Estate-Primarily in Decentraland because of its potential. Not only can you play on Decentraland but you can build wealth, where you might not be able to afford to build wealth IRL, there is nothing stopping anyone from investing in themselves and virtual land on Decentraland.\n\nI will create easy processes to buy, sell, trade and even rent on Decentraland. Part of the reason people hesitate into jumping into new technology is that they are uneducated. My platforms will be happy to educate and welcome any questions for new and experienced crypto real estate investors.\n\nI will donate proceeds from the grant into giveaways to gather new followers and users to the platform because everyone loves airdrops and giveaways!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI will be posting on my Tiktok, YouTube, Clash, IG Reels and FB Reels and using Analytics and SEO to drive organic traffic to the Decentraland platform.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAt this time I will be the sole person on the project, however, I am open to finding the right fit to help partner some of the work with someone familiar with the Decentraland platform.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n3 month time table:\n\nMonth 1\n\\-Advertise on tiktok and youtube, telegrams and discords\n\\-Research and create video content to focus the niche.\n\\-Start educating and giving away Decentraland, especially since we are low right now it will be really great to showcase the gains from the dip!\n\\-Start buying Decentraland\n\nMonth 2\n\\-Advertise on tiktok and youtube, telegrams and discords\n\\-Show everyone how to make passive income by renting out spaces.\n\\-Start Flipping Land-educating on how to flip\n\\-Bring more social media attention to Decentraland and all it's offerings\n\nMonth 3\n\\-Advertise on tiktok and youtube, telegrams and discords\n\\-Show more creative ways to make passive income on Decentraland and why it is the best Metaverse out there\n\\-Create Crypto real estate meeting classes where people on Decentraland can gather and network their ideas on Decentraland\n\\-Continue Giveaways to drive more organic, interested new users of Decentraland so they can grow along with Decentraland.\nBy this time people will Know, Like and Trust the team and the social medias so we can continue to spread the word and make Decentraland the best Metaverse out there!\n\nThis is all a work in progress. I am excited about the project and know it can be a great success. As I go I know I will continually meet people who will help the project grow into something amazing!\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f5925e10-8180-11ec-9166-a5dd0ddb7cdb)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":14104863,"end":1644119940,"start":1643515140,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x7d65d4e89bba50d6849812d1f7c534032fa9c3974278effdddd9245d83125d7848ad071b746d7ee9c72930bc23880b1deb4538f24361438caa9004599b0465561b","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":21973,"discourse_topic_id":7142,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmvyqqw-crypto-real-estate-education","user":"0xc9ea520f77cecdef90b47a8dadd739bbea4d73cb","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Crypto Real Estate Education","description":"Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am currently a licensed Realtor in Connecticut and New York, USA.

Decentraland has a perfect platform to bring together isolated individuals and communities and to allow Deaf experts to be the purveyors of their own language and culture.  Creating a place where people could become immersed in a cultural experience, learn a new language, see and hear stories and histories as well as receive support and access services without barriers.  Many countries still do not have disability rights legislation or recognize signed languages.  This could be a truly global community.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x62b89CEbc70086F132D75fB8D8A4E3f7920642A1\n\n## Description\n\nSchools for the Deaf are closing as the population is small and the cost is seen as a drain for a relatively small population.  Access to services is limited, many sites have moved to remote interpreting but a head-on iPad is not sufficient for a child still developing sign language who needs to see more of the signing space to be understood and to understand.  ASL and Deaf culture are beautiful and need to be shared with the world while allowing people to create a community of barrier-free access to education, shopping, customer support, education, legal, mental health and physical health services and more.\\\nMany countries, Canada included, do not have disability rights legislation and do not recognize sign language as an access and human rights issue.  Deaf people sit in hospital waiting rooms without access to information, jails and are not provided with appropriate support.

a local scene editor to work with the Decentraland SDK","body":"> by 0xad3b9da5a39ac752c8340e2a7676f083246ea4d1 (HiImChris#a4d1)\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWorking with the Decentraland SDK allows to code complex behaviors, but developers are limited to using their code editor of choice when doing so and can't easily switch between coding and building with the Decentraland Builder. This is especially tedious when creating and placing new entities into the scene.\nWe are currently finalizing the development of a first stable version of DCL-Edit, a visual editor designed to work in parallel with the Decentraland SDK (see https://dcl-edit.com).\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x2a9Da28bCbF97A8C008Fd211f5127b860613922D\n\n## Description\n\nDCL-Edit enables you to instantly switch between coding and designing your scene, just like it is the case with modern game engines like Unity. This, of course, can dramatically increase the speed at which you code and design your experience for Decentraland.\n\nWith DCL-Edit, you can place, transform, scale, and rotate entities just like in Unity and give them identifiers that you can instantly refer to in your code. A visual asset browser gives you a nice overview of the available assets and lets you easily pick and place one into your scene.\n\nFeature Overview for this version\n\n*   place, transform, scale, and rotate entities\n*   add basic shape components\n*   asset browser for GLTF Shapes\n*   assign identifiers to entities\n*   undo functionality\n*   parenting of objects\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDCL-Edit is developed in Unity and will be downloadable as a npm package. It will be licensed under the MIT license. In its current state, the above features are already functional, but we need to put additional work into refactoring, testing and debugging to deliver a stable version.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are developing this as representatives of the MetaGameHub DAO, a community that is heavily involved in the evolving Metaverse and Blockchain Space (check out https://www.metagamehub.io).\n\nSpecifically, we have 3 people working on this:\n\nJonathan Luebeck - Lead Programmer - years of experience in Unity\n\nMichael Gantner - Programmer, Shader Programming - years of experience in Unity\n\nChristian Werner - Project Lead - game developer and lecturer in Game Design\n\nTowards the end, we will execute an extensive testing period with more people.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe minimal requirements for a smooth workflow (see above feature lists) are already implemented, so in the next 3-4 weeks we will be working on a stable release version that everybody can seamlessly integrate into their workflow.\n\nAs a compensation for these last steps and as a sign of appreciation for the whole project, we kindly ask to receive a Tier 3 grant of $5.000 USD in $MANA.\n\nIn the future, DCL-Edit is planned to become a full-fledged editor for developing complex scenes with the Decentraland SDK.

That is, Pawnfi enables NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, Pawnfi will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.\n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi supports users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help Pawnfi devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what Pawnfi plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help to build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understands that it is not user-friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre.

That is, Pawnfi enables NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, Pawnfi will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n30,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.\n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi supports users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understands that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, Pawnfi supports players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short-term cash flow (without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long!). Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a \"Loan + Sale\" together.\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visiting this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short-term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest income. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders:\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven that building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only purchase from secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not be able to sell it in the future. With this Rental Centre, renters can try out new wearables for short-term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and building a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world,  Pawnfi wants to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and enlightening builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland Pawnfi can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, Pawnfi also help the players to obtain the gaming experience without jumping back and forth between different platforms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and is a ready-to-launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help Pawnfi devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what Pawnfi plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help to build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understands that it is not user-friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between third party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre.

The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.\n\nThe Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices. The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe entire grant will be used to acquire land(1 parcel) that we have recognized as a good location to begin our development. Renting land is both difficult and hard\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n20,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f\n\n## Description\n\n‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q\\&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies.\n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access.\n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold. We are resubmitting it with the recent DAO changes and hope to get approved.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU\n\nThe building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.\n\nRavi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/\n\nMathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/\n\nArun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe roadmap for the project is as below\n\nJanuary - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.\n\nFebruary - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam). This would be accompanied by other films.\n\nApril-June - Conducting events at scale with month-long programming.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5ab622d0-7606-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":14010268,"end":1643462580,"start":1642252980,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xf7d6ce0b12a1f084e35c5f2fe6a37d99ddee36ffc06fde94af441ecd1598950704db0ed10a5e020edc7811a0c1ec18d168bf51421d3ea590a3d998624d91f3be1c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":17498,"discourse_topic_id":5923,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmclfv7-cinematheque-that-can-host-24x7-film-screening-archive-film-paraphernalia","user":"0xb5e34509cf4004ecb51392398d7c18b1d8a0db3f","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Cinematheque that can host 24x7 film screening & archive film paraphernalia","description":"Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n‘Filmrare’ is a Travelling Cinematheque that can host Film Screenings, Archive films & film-related artifacts.

The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.\n\nThe Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices. The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe entire grant will be used to acquire land(1 parcel) that we have recognized as a good location to begin our development. Renting land is both difficult and hard","category":"Content Creator","tier":"Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff)","size":20000,"beneficiary":"0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f","description":"‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema. While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. The first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region.\n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day. We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nWe also intend to acquire rights from other cult classics and screen them as and when Metaverse Movies become more common. We have made some inroads with the rights owners of American Horror Classics & the Iron Dragon movies. \n\nThe intention is to have a 24x7 cinema hall where we publish a month-long program guide and users can walk into any show from any timezone. There will be filler events like standups & live music. Some of them would be ticketed events and most of them would be free to walk in.\n\nVideo streaming on Web3 is still not up to the mark with that of Web2. To solve this we are going to be working very closely with Protocol Labs(Filecoin) on media storage and HD delivery. We also would be developing a platform where it becomes possible to schedule screenings and tie them with ERC-1155 tokens that can be purchased to get access. \n\nOur previous grant request was well-received(20 Yes to 2 Nos) but failed to cross the minimum threshold.

That is, we enable NFT/ GameFi/ Metaverse players to create Pawn (collateral loan), Lease (rent), and Sale purposefully or simultaneously within one transaction.\n\nBy supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place, we will provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than just \"buy and sell\" - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x6A44e6C59e2Fa54962e67a70Dd0A34FdC117Be85\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, the pain point of Asset inventory is that other than buy/ build and sell, there is no other way for NFT holders or  Metaverse players to create liquidity and cash flow.\n\nFor this reason, mirroring the practice in real world that how we treat with many of our assets (Real estate for example), Pawnfi support users to make fully use of their ERC-20/ NFTs: Not only can use it to apply for collateral loan, but you can at the same time rent out to others, and/ or place it for sale. That is, liquidity will be unleashed in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi's vision is to directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. There are two parts in this Centre\n\n### Pawnshop:\n\nBorrower:\n\nIn this Pawnshop, we support players to use their ERC-20 token (MANA) or NFTs (Wearables/ LAND) as collateral to borrow funds. While these collaterals are normally not accepted in outside world, Pawnfi will support them at first place to enable them obtain short term cash flow without selling it urgently to give up ownership for long. Of course, based on our smart contract, they can place it for sale at the same time. That is, they can easily combine a Loan + Sale\n\nLender:\n\nWhen visit this Pawnshop, lenders with sufficient fund can provide short term cash flow to borrowers and earn interest revenue. It can be a new use case of Play-to-earn.\n\n### Rental Centre\n\nBuilders\n\nInstead of selling their creations for one-time income, builders can place their wearables here and rent out to others. They can now change their creation into a long-term business and earn stable income.\n\nRenters:\n\nGiven building wearables is tech-knowledge required, players can only buy in secondary market. However, wearables are seldom for investment purpose. That is, buying it is unlikely to be the most efficient way as players might not able to sell it in future. With this Rental Centre, players can try out new wearables for short term period without monetization issue. It will lower the threshold to have fun, which will attract more players to explore in Decentraland.\n\nIn conclusion, by supporting Decentraland Assets (MANA and NFTs) at first place and build a Panwshop/ Rental Centre directly in DCL world we want to provide more financial attributes to DCL players, maximizing the utility and educate builders/ investors/ players that their inventories are more than buy and sell - in Decentraland we can do bigger than that; and of course at the same time, obtain the gaming experience without asking players to jump back and forth between different platforms.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPawnfi smart contract has been code audited by Peckshield and we are a ready to launch platform. Our public testing in coming weeks will alr support all kinds of DCL assets. However, acquiring funding through DAO would help us devote more to development, and hire UI designer/ architecture to build up a native pawnshop/ rental centre in Decentraland. Here is what we plan to enhance and improve:\n\n**Pawnfi Platform UI Optimization** To make the whole UI/ UX more accommodating to Decentraland and the overall experience more smooth, we’ll hire UI Designer to help us build a more solid Interface. This is a high priority because when go live we want to onboard DCL players at first place when go live and make the UX more immersive.\n\n**Native Pawnshop and Rental Centre** Pawnfi understand that it is not user friendly to make Metaverse players jump back and forth between thrid party platform and gaming environment. For this reason, Pawnfi will directly build a native Centre in Decentraland. We will bring in developer/ architecture. It’s vital to ensure the user experience and audience can be kept in DCL world.\n\n**Build Relationship with Builders** We want to onboard the best creators/ builders to place their new wearables in our Rental Centre. While Pawnfi will normally charge service fee for placing rentals, for DCL creators we will provide rebate, which means contributing our service revenue to DCL community.\n\nFor more details, please refer to product deck:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/176naRyblIEVbvJ8NqV5VMbbm65feugAc/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### Wesley - Chief Executive Officer\n\nCFA Charterholder with more than 5 years experience in investment industry, specializing in security Lending & Borrowing business.

Despite this, we managed to write our own program for the cryptocurrency exchanger, which stands out with speed and security.\n\nThe cryptocurrency exchanger is a central part of the entire ecosphere. We designed program so that it would be as easy to connect other services (for example, integrate the exchanger into the marketplace).\n\n### Other projects in system\n\n**Processing** - The user remains on the site, he doesn't need to go to external systems. This will speed up the payment processing from our side.\n\n**Acquiring**  - Our own acquiring will allow us to reduce commissions for our clients. Besides, acquiring integrated into the system also allows sellers and buyers to receive additional benefits on our platform, for example, cashback.\n\n**Decentralized marketplace**  - In our marketplace, it will be possible to buy goods for both fiat and various cryptocurrencies. This will eliminate one regulator and reduce fees. We will be able to minimize costs and organize healthy competition in product markets with a large number of small participants. At the same time, neither sellers nor buyers will pay commissions, which will reduce the cost of goods.\n\n**NFT service** - NFT service with auction and stock exchange for art freelancers with all functions for accepting, distributing accounting and storing funds. The benefits for sellers and buyers are the same as in the marketplace - the services are interconnected and there are no commissions.\n\nOne of our team members is a certified economist with experience in large banks, so the economic model of our cryptocurrency exchanger is working and already brings some profit.\nFor other services, the economic model is also already being worked out.\n\nBut having a small team imposes its own limitations. We can't work on both the backend and the frontend at the same time. Therefore, the design and functionality in some moments lags behind the competitors.\n\n### So, we need funds for\n\n*   **Programmers** - to work in parallel on several modules;\n\n*   **Web designer** - to improve the usability of all services;\n\n*   **Lawyer** - to resolve disputes and protect us and our partners;\n\n*   **Marketing and sales department** - to promote services.\n\n### Links:\n\n1.

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/COFEOX/comments/rmpvrx/cofpreico_cofeox_cryptocurrency_exchanger/)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe main functions of the exchanger will be implemented in Decentraland. Our team will work to convert a simple exchange on the website into a currency exchange in a bank. At the same time, the user's avatar will be able to make exchanges both in the common space and in a private room - an analogue of a personal account on the site during registration. In addition to notification of a successful exchange, the avatar will be issued checks in Decentraland.\n\nWe want to visualize the exchange itself, as it can happen in reality with a virtual cashier. It will ensure maximum realism.\nAfter that, the visual space of the bank will be created with cashiers, operators, etc. That is, the user will get the full feeling of being in the bank. Virtual contracts will also be created.\n\nThe exchange itself will be carried out through an exchange office, where neuroblockchain technology is being developed, taking into account the possibility of hidden transfers, transfers without confirmation, transfers with confirmation and multitracts. The ability to program tasks, create and track digital contracts and contracts, the ability to store data.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n1.  Dmitriy - **Programmer**\n2.  Anton - **Economist**\n3.

The aim of this space is to build a communal experience around cinema by encouraging diverse voices to exhibit their films and enabling different audiences to engage with filmmakers, Films & Film History.\n\nThe Cinematheque will host independent films across Art House, Genre Cinema & Diverse Upcoming Voices.  The primary driver of the experience will be the curation of the films which is aimed to spark conversation and drive engagement in the metaverse around the cinema.\n\nThe Grant will be used to rent land & pay screening fees to the filmmakers.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xb5E34509cf4004ecB51392398D7C18B1D8a0DB3f\n\n## Description\n\n‘Filmrare’ will be a cultural destination in Decentraland with daily screenings & conversations around Cinema.

While the primary focus will be on screening films, there will be sidebar events including Q&As, Workshops, and exhibitions of Video Installations. \nThe first edition will focus on South Asian Cinema and feature films by leading filmmakers from the region. \n\nThe pandemic has disrupted and affected entertainment but more particularly so the independent filmmakers. The chances of attending film festivals and markets are becoming slimmer each day.  We believe that a dedicated space in DCL could spawn a new age of community experience that has made watching cinema one of the best forms of art. As a permanent space in DCL, this place would host events, screenings, and conversations for filmmakers to connect with audiences, buyers, and investors.\n\nThe grant money will be used to rent a parcel for 6 months. We intend to rent a 100 MANA parcel with a deposit of 200 MANA. The remaining amount of close to $2000 will be used to incentivize filmmakers for giving us the rights to screen their films.","specification":"The cinematheque has been built on a single parcel as a two-storey building that houses a gallery on the ground floor and a theater in the first. A demo can be seen here -> https://youtu.be/AtczYVUIoLU\n\nThe building is being built using Blender 3D models and the DCL SDK. We also have a screening site https://filmrare.com where we have used ERC-1155 tokens to provide access to content. We intend to use the same technology here for ticketed events where the token holders would be allowed to watch screenings.","personnel":"The team consists of the below three members who bring engineering, creativity, and industry experience.\n\nRavi Krishnan, Founder of Filmrare ->https://www.linkedin.com/in/krcnow/\n\nMathivanan Rajendran, Program Director at Root.ax -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathivananr/\n\nArun Karthick BAFTA Breakthrough director -> https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/breakthrough/arun-karthick-directorwriter","roadmap":"The roadmap for the project is as below\n\nJanuary - Parcel acquisition and scene deployment. Testing with BETA users for the multiplayer experience, live streaming, and ERC-1155 based ticketing.\n\nFebruary - Public domain movie screenings by creating events in DCL. Pitching to filmmakers and lining up the editorial. Pitching to film festivals. Early testing of screening plus socializing.\n\nMarch - Key date set for the one month of Cinematheque screenings is Mar 15 - April 20, 2022. The headlining screening will be the screening of films by Arun Karthick (BAFTA Breakthrough India Honouree) (Nasir (2020) | NETPAC winner, International Film Festival of Rotterdam).

The studio has already made its mark on the NFT space with futuristic 3D art, AR/VR tools for collectors, Metaverse exploration and an extremely passionate community.\n\nA portfolio of your work to date:\nhttps://chibilabs.io/\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/chibi-genesis\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/chibi-apes\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/chibi-galaxy\n\nChibis P2E Game whereby anyone in decentraland can participate in a scavenger style hunt across our futuristic-dystopian-punk-cyber-jungle and city landscape.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n80,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xac0b0cd0268b5a9166de11a94e931e8e0cad1dbb\n\n## Description\n\nWe believe that we are bringing new metaverse users to decentraland.  We have 60,000 people in our discord and ~3,000+ unique holders across ~6,700 unique NFTs.   Our user base is not the \"old school\" decentraland or \"OG\" NFT collectors.  The majority of our userbase is new to the NFT and Metaverse space.\n\nAs a project we have invested heavily in decentraland as we see dcl as such a meaning place for building our community and expanding our overall reach to the web3 community.\nWe are hosting a New Years Day party with 15+ Projects, a grammy nominated artist (Aloe Blacc), SpottieWifi, and hope to bring as many users online as possible in dcl.\n\nWhile we love 'partying' in the metaverse, we want to show our community and the world what the next level looks like for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation in the metaverse.   We also want to create \"Sticky-ness\" and a symbiotic relationship between Decentraland, our NFT holders, and the entire DCL and Web3 community.\n\nOur team and our community has been researching Play-to-Earn and we see a very valid use case for Chibi Labs and the Chibi Nation to build out a Play to Earn game in DCL.\n\nWe know that Play-to-Earn is the next way for us to show our community about the next chapter of the metaverse.  Aside from Wondermine and the casinos, play-to-earn seems super early in Decentraland.  We understand the importance We have been impressed with the \"Sticky-ness\" of Wondermine and hope that we can show DCL, our community and the world that our Play to Earn strategy will be fun, and keep users coming back.\n\nWe also seek your guidance and strategy as to what can and can't be done with Play-to-Earn in DCL.  We pride ourselves on investigating every edge of the Metaverse landscape.  At Chibi Labs, we  consider this just the beginning of our Journey in Decentraland.\n\nAs a project and as a community, we will always do whatever we can to increase awareness about the metaverse, decentraland, and web3 safety.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nChibis P2E Game (Decentraland) (abbrev...)\n1.Players will traverse the Chibi dystopian punk jungle to acquire 5-10 colorful GEMS in a Scavenger hunt type of format.\n2\\. To fit our lore, the \"gems\" would be \"Comprised of Silica\" will be placed in our \"conveyer belt\" room  in our Chibi Town to be converted into “microchips”\n3\\. Using \"Microchips\", players can redeem \"Chibi Coins\" (for DCL only)\n4\\. Daily Multiplier rewards to encourage daily engagement and \"Sticky-ness\".\n\nPlayers will race each other to complete a timed event that will be a checkpoint race course through the map that can be redesigned to make for different races. ---Simply using a highlighted ball of light or something to indicate where to go will be enough.\n\nPOAP’s will be given to the high score of the day, and or one given to the highest score of the week/month. (1 of 1 POAP)(date/time/players name/etc)\n\nLeaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion\n\nPOAPs could be given to player with flawless victory (all 7 days in a week)\n\nPOAPs potential redemption process could include a chance to win a chibination\ndecentraland item or even an actual chibi\n\nLeaderboards need to be auto updated with usernames and times of completion\n\nAdvertising Space on the walls of the Conveyer belt room and other office spaces needs to be easily changed for promotions and opportunities for sponsored ads\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nFounding Team\n\n1.

We recreate all of our physical exhibits in the metaverse. We have built in Cryptovoxels, Somnium Space, VRChat, Mona.Gallery, scanned our spaces with Matterport, and are committed to bridging digital to physical. We have a physical gallery and venue, IRL Underground, based in Denver, CO we host DAO supported NFT exhibits in. Since 2019 we have also been the art stewards of ETHDenver, managing the Art Gallery and Auction build and curation.\n\nYou can find us at: https://twitter.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://instagram.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://irlunderground.com | https://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1253594843798Ff0fcd7Fa221B820C2d3cA58FD5\n\n## Description\n\nPlease view our full proposal doc here: https://bit.ly/3zaEi2v\n\nOver the next 6 months, Decentraland will be the primary metaverse we focus on and build in for ETHDenver, EFDevconnect, Sonic Bloom, and other high impact opportunities. Our goal in decentraland is to recreate the main conference building, the Sports Castle, at ETHDenver 2022, highlight, and showcase 100 + featured artists at the official ETHDenver Art Gallery and Auction. Artists can choose a commission from 0 - 100%, with their designated commission going to a beneficiary. This year the commission will go to Gitcoin; to benefit Art focused Public Goods.\n\nOur two calls for artists can be found here:\nirlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery\nirlunderground.com/gitcoin\n\nThis year's panel of curators of the gallery have diverse backgrounds, spanning multiple creative initiatives around art and technology. Annie Phillips, of IRL Art, Robert Gray of IRL Art, Shivani Mitra of Museum of Crypto Art, and Jessica Angel of Art Project Decentralized.\n\nWe will work with our collaborators in the NEAR Ecosytem, who created our video last year, to have a video made of the gallery to post on social media.\n\nLast years video: https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7B-w4n4Gb/\n\nWe will share the video directly with all of the approximately 100 participating artists and facilitators to promote decentraland, the auction, the artists, and ETHDenver.\n\nAdditionally, we will livestream builds, interview participating builders, and share those through DCL Reports and Boombox Heads twitch streams. Our inhouse video team will additionally make periodic recaps of our progress and builds.\n\nIn the ETHDenver gallery, we will have decentraland vinyl and printed graphics on a display around a large TV that will host the video with a QR code to visit the parcels. We will provide (2) VR headsets to conference attendees to experience the gallery physically and virtually within Decentraland. The conference will have over 5000 attendees physically, and thousands more can tune in virtually through GamerJibe and our potential Decentraland Gallery.\n\nWe currently don't own any parcels of land in any metaverse. This would be our first ability to integrate and explore more features, like adding contributors, and creating wearables, which is only accessible to land owners. It will allow us more long term ability to add new contributors, provide educational, hands-on opportunities for more creators in our collective to learn and engage with Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will complete this project internally with the 7 team members, our larger network of collaborators and partners, and the additional 8 granted collaborators.\n\nPlease view our previous projects here:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fractilians\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/boomboxheads\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAnnie Stardust -\n\n*   Founder of IRL Art, Digital Artist and Art Director working primarily in Cinema 4D, with a background in animation, content development, 3D world building, early NFT artist, onboarded over 400 artists into NFTs, and art steward for ETHDenver since 2019.\n\nYultek - Multimedia Artist, Graphic Designer, Metaverse Architect, AR/VR content producer - Lead designer and installer for IRLart - @yultek\\_\n\nGodfrey - Virtual Reality Developer, Crypto Artist working in 3d / VR, Virtual Production, Virtual Art Galleries, VR Music Videos, Music Producer, Real-TIme Production and Streaming\n\nFractilians - Digital + Analog  Visual Arts Educator + Content Creation. 3D/VR , Streaming, Video production.

Since 2019 we have also been the art stewards of ETHDenver, managing the Art Gallery and Auction build and curation.\n\nYou can find us at: https://twitter.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://instagram.com/irlart\\_\\_ | https://irlunderground.com | https://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x1253594843798Ff0fcd7Fa221B820C2d3cA58FD5\n\n## Description\n\nPlease view our full proposal doc here: https://bit.ly/3zaEi2v\n\nOver the next 6 months, Decentraland will be the primary metaverse we focus on and build in for ETHDenver, EFDevconnect, Sonic Bloom, and other high impact opportunities. Our goal in decentraland is to recreate the main conference building, the Sports Castle, at ETHDenver 2022, highlight, and showcase 100 + featured artists at the official ETHDenver Art Gallery and Auction. Artists can choose a commission from 0 - 100%, with their designated commission going to a beneficiary. This year the commission will go to Gitcoin; to benefit Art focused Public Goods.\n\nOur two calls for artists can be found here:\nirlunderground.com/eth-denver-gallery\nirlunderground.com/gitcoin\n\nThis year's panel of curators of the gallery have diverse backgrounds, spanning multiple creative initiatives around art and technology. Annie Phillips, of IRL Art, Robert Gray of IRL Art, Shivani Mitra of Museum of Crypto Art, and Jessica Angel of Art Project Decentralized.\n\nWe will work with our collaborators in the NEAR Ecosytem, who created our video last year, to have a video made of the gallery to post on social media.\n\nLast years video: https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7B-w4n4Gb/\n\nWe will share the video directly with all of the approximately 100 participating artists and facilitators to promote decentraland, the auction, the artists, and ETHDenver.\n\nAdditionally, we will livestream builds, interview participating builders, and share those through DCL Reports and Boombox Heads twitch streams. Our inhouse video team will additionally make periodic recaps of our progress and builds.\n\nIn the ETHDenver gallery, we will have decentraland vinyl and printed graphics on a display around a large TV that will host the video with a QR code to visit the parcels. We will provide (2) VR headsets to conference attendees to experience the gallery physically and virtually within Decentraland. The conference will have over 5000 attendees physically, and thousands more can tune in virtually through GamerJibe and our potential Decentraland Gallery.\n\nWe currently don't own any parcels of land in any metaverse. This would be our first ability to integrate and explore more features, like adding contributors, and creating wearables, which is only accessible to land owners. It will allow us more long term ability to add new contributors, provide educational, hands-on opportunities for more creators in our collective to learn and engage with Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe will complete this project internally with the 7 team members, our larger network of collaborators and partners, and the additional 8 granted collaborators.\n\nPlease view our previous projects here:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/irlvirtual\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/fractilians\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/boomboxheads\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nAnnie Stardust -\n\n*   Founder of IRL Art, Digital Artist and Art Director working primarily in Cinema 4D, with a background in animation, content development, 3D world building, early NFT artist, onboarded over 400 artists into NFTs, and art steward for ETHDenver since 2019.\n\nYultek - Multimedia Artist, Graphic Designer, Metaverse Architect, AR/VR content producer - Lead designer and installer for IRLart - @yultek\\_\n\nGodfrey - Virtual Reality Developer, Crypto Artist working in 3d / VR, Virtual Production, Virtual Art Galleries, VR Music Videos, Music Producer, Real-TIme Production and Streaming\n\nFractilians - Digital + Analog  Visual Arts Educator + Content Creation. 3D/VR , Streaming, Video production.

I have been a everyday gamer since I was 14 years old. Now 39, I have 3 wonderful kids (2,9,&12) that are gamers with the little one catching up fast to be a future gamer. Due to my old Laptop (2017) Been having major issues playing Decentraland, as far as I got was jumping into the portal after the tutorial. I don't have a strong enough graphics in my laptop to play. This grant would enable me and my kids to purchase a Gamer PC. I have always used PS, Wii, oculus...etc., in the past with no need for a gaming PC. Not being able to afford a Gaming PC means not playing Decentraland and not being able to contribute. I would contribute in every way possible. I have $100 usd in Mana stored in my coinbase account waiting for my family and I to play. I have contributed in ever venture that stands beside me to the max. Unfortunately without this grant might it be years before we will experience the future of gaming Decentraland. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nI will use 100% of funds in buying a computer to run and contribute in decentraland. First i would buy  Alienware Aurora R10 Ryzen 1400-1700. Any funds left will buy accessories like mouse keyboard and screen. In the past I have built PCs for friends, apon thinking more I believe the smartest idea is to buy it already built. As soon as I have the PC I will run decentraland and contribute any and everyway possible.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nMyself Allen, my daughter Azalea with my son Jacob. I have been working on NFTs on https://crypto.com/nft/profile/atheistalien.

Originally posted by Joe)\n\n**WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game** where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935\n\n## Description\n\nWhen creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAcquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements** To make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs** Many of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers** Currently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining. Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game.** The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game** Some of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**The team**\n\n*   **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n*   **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **Lew Co-founder**, 3D artist\n*   **maruudn**, Community manager\n*   **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)**, 3D artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**2022 Q1**\n\n*   Server improvements\n*   WonderZone NFTs\n*   Shared meteors\n*   New wearables\n*   Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n*   In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n*   Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n*   More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n*   Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n*   In-game Pets\n*   More wearables\n*   Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n*   Restructuring of the park\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6557be60-5f59-11ec-8188-4352ce3d30e7)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13823790,"end":1640969400,"start":1639759800,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x7ff4ee89c7768cccd0ea6e4fa121fb092dbfddad5c998394a2f68e81fc2124f401c51e4ca33ec5b059b3f4c6c1140e5d1ecda61adcff9d7cfcfa2ba849d97bc51c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":10553,"discourse_topic_id":3868,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmabbju-expanding-and-improving-wonderzone-resubmission","user":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","type":"grant","status":"enacted","title":"Expanding and improving WonderZone (resubmission)","description":"Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n(This proposal has been resubmitted using the new VP thresholds and voting period.

Having launched in 2020, it currently has over 5000+ downloads and has been used to create VR games and enterprise-grade applications. The Byldr team is excited to bring more VR and AR capabilities to Decentraland for a fully realized Metaverse experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n220,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x9A739c2e212754c3d8432CB717dC9437e5b3Dfae\n\n## Description\n\nByldr's creators believe that the future of computing involves the movement away from traditional 2D screens and towards immersive, 3D spatial computing. As of this writing, Decentraland is a 3D metaverse that ironically can only be experienced and built through a flat, 2D screen. Byldr was created for AR and VR applications to be created using AR and VR headsets rather than 2D PCs, thereby getting humanity one step closer to a mixed reality future. Byldr's developers seek to further expand this progress by enabling creators to build experiences for Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. This allows creators to feel the scale of their creations while creating it, and accelerate the speed of creation using Byldr's intuitive hand-tracking interactions and spatial tools. Creators will be able to see or preview their creations in-context within Decentraland using Byldr. This means that Byldr may also be used as a gateway to experience Decentraland using the Quest 2 and the HoloLens 2.\n\nThe Byldr development team is excited to bring our trusted immersive creation experience to Decentraland and would like to thank everyone in the Decentraland community for your support and the integral part you play in building the XR future for all generations to come.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nByldr's development team proposes to integrate with Decentraland in the following ways:\n\n1.  Allow experiences and scenes created using Byldr to be exported to Decentraland.\n    Byldr will be retooled to be able to export creations built using Byldr into Decentraland. After a user has created an interactive or static experience within Byldr, the user will have the option to export that experience to Decentraland, including where the experience will be placed. Users will also be able to edit or update these experiences after being published. Byldr will be updated to tightly integrate with Decentraland with the goal of making Byldr feel like a native extension for building Decentraland experiences.\n\n2.  Allow users to experience Decentraland using VR and AR headsets. Although not the primary goal of this grant, re-tooling Byldr to create experiences for Decentraland will also involve the ability for users to experience Decentraland in AR and VR through Byldr (similar to how users can experience Decentraland through a browser such as Google Chrome on a PC.) It is understood that other parallel efforts are being made to enable VR support for Decentraland, so this project will focus primarily on content creation within AR and VR. That said, if these efforts by Byldr allow VR support for Decentraland to come sooner, it will be a win for the Decentraland community and provide additional means/devices to experience Decentraland (Byldr currently supports the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2 headsets.) We understand that rendering the Decentraland experience on mobile-grade XR devices like the Quest and HoloLens presents it's own set of performance challenges. The Byldr team intends to utilize several XR optimization techniques to allow for Decentraland to be a performant experience on a mobile XR device while minimizing quality loss (compared to running on a PC browser with a dedicated graphics card.) Some of these techniques may involve more aggressive culling of faraway objects, using mobile-optimized shaders, distance-based level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, foveated rendering, and other techniques.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### The Byldr team comprises:\n\nSean Ong (Team technical lead / manager)\n\nStephen Clarke (Management)\n\nKetan Kapila (3D modeling/tooling)\n\nDerek Bolton (Management)\n\nVarun Siddaraju (Technical project manager and senior developer)\n\nClint Campbell (XR developer)\n\nPaul Gumpert (XR developer)\n\nCole Astaire (Technical artist)\n\nClinton Reddie (XR developer)\n\nVeeRuby Technologies (Byldr's development partner)\n\nAppVolks LLC (Byldr's development partner)\n\nXR Dev Studio (Byldr's development partner)\n\nCollectively, Byldr's team members have over 100 person-years of XR development experience.

It is a real-life-like virtual shopping experience online 100% in 3D from any PC. We are working to bring the most important banks and retail banks to join this Meta Mall. We could do all transactions via Mana. Please visit the Meta Mall at www.go2virtual.shop\n\nThe problems we solve: no one online shipping experience lets a real-time 3D virtual but real experience to shoppers. Meta Mall makes real the \"try-before-you-buy\". The Metaverse needs a lot of Meta Mall and this proposal is ready-to-go to market with pretty corporate marketing to add the big retailers and banks to an immersive experience for their customers.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xc898485289c4f1E8d1bBEd5d175F9B6e1224df53\n\n## Description\n\nThe funds will be used in the following improvements:\n\n1.  To perform the shopping experience using the avatars already playing in Decentraland\n2.  To swift the payment term to Mana crypto instead of debit and credit cards\n3.  To integrate the current experience into  Decentraland environment\n4.  Corporative marketing  to add the main banks and brands in the Meta Mall of Decentraland\n5.  To create wow stores for the big brands with the Decentraland CG community\n\nA high-level skilled team is working together since May 2019 and it is integrated by 10 professionals including  3D artists,  3D UI professionals, Unreal programmers, Front-End, and backend developers. This team will lead all CG community members to develop stores and assets performed according to the needs of Meta Mall technologies.\n\nAll the stores for the companies will be a giant win opportunity for the CG community and the Metaverse users in general.  MANA will be used not only in shopping transactions but also to reward the CG contributions ( 3D stores and 3D assets).

This module will be made available to the community to help build up the repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a useful scene that can be freely implemented into existing land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,500 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Description\n\nStandard users within Decentraland (DCL) have quite a few resources on-hand to build a display to show off their NFTs, but all of them require a fair bit of work to. Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land). I believe that enabling users to not only create but also share their content easily will be key to building up this platform.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo, again :). I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame.

Users without programming experience can use the Builder to construct their own scenes or find some tutorials on YouTube, but this takes a lot of time for them to reach their simple goal of displaying their NFTs (especially if they are new to the space). Users with an understanding of how to code can read through the SDK and experience example scenes, but (once again) this is a time consuming process for most. On top of that, the quality of implementation will vary in the extreme.\n\nWhat I am to do with this module is provide general users with a module that can save them time and provide a good base-line for a quality display. This is a utility many users have been looking for and will no doubt provide a significant value to the community. By making more complex features within DCL more accessible via simplified interfaces we can get more users involved in developing the project's digital space. We can also provide users who lack an understanding of programming solutions that would otherwise be unavailable to them.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis module will allow users to display their art by interacting with a single well-documented file. The core functionality of the module will be hidden from the user, making management of their content significantly easier. Advanced users will also find it easy to modify the provided repository to form it to fit their own need. The default scene itself will feature a large display space for many NFTs, with the building sized for a 3x3 estate.\n\nThe completed module will also contain a walk-through of how to add NFTs to the project's scene and how to host their scene as a website for free (as an early development alternative to deploying the scene onto land). I believe that enabling users to not only create but also share their content easily will be key to building up this platform.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'll be working on this project solo, again :).

We already have some mockup for the nfts and a pretty well established roadmap.\nNote that NFT holders will be able to claim tokens every week! ($ MSP) on a value of 1.2 per NFT owned!\n\nI am therefore asking for your help to finance the project and finally launch what we have wanted to do for a long time !!\n\nWhy not adapt our nft to a metaverse game afterwards!\n\nThanks again for reading!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe would be on a long-term vision, that is to say that our nft will provide you with free underwear for life (around 2 per year per nft) all thanks to the nft owning!\nThe token gain will be there to reward our nft holders and give you access to votes for future partners or for the next event.\nAll we need is the development of smart contracts and an integration on a website (almost entirely done).\nThe more you hold, the more your opinion will have an impact on the future of the project! We are counting on you and your support!\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThere are 3 of us on the project and we know that having to change our underwear is a really nasty task! the price may vary and you will waste part of your budget for future vacations!

WonderMine is often the most popular location in Decentraland, with over 10,000 daily users in recent days.\n\nWe want to improve WonderMine and the other games in the WonderZone Amusement Park, making WonderZone and Decentraland the go-to places for play-to-earn metaverse games.\n\nLink to WonderMine: https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-28%2C56\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xfcacAcE2713D41c02666E2643E5583793196c935\n\n## Description\n\nWhen creating WonderMine, our initial goal was to give players a fun reason to log in to Decentraland every day. We started with simple game mechanics, resources, and crafting rules so people can immediately start playing without a steep learning curve. We also wanted it to be a social hub for Decentraland players.\n\nWe are proud of what we have built so far, and the great player community that has formed around the game. But improving the game has taken longer than we wanted. We owe it to the players to add game play features and offer more craftable wearables and NFTs. As a part-time team we haven’t had the time or funding to fully dedicate ourselves to WonderZone.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nAcquiring funding through the DAO would let us dedicate more time to development, and hire an additional developer to help us improve WonderMine and other games in WonderZone park. Here is what we plan on expanding and improving:\n\n**Server improvements**\nTo make the crafting experience and the overall gameplay experience more smooth, we’ll bring on a server-side developer to help us build a more solid server infrastructure. This is a high priority because we’ve had server performance issues during previous events, with a sudden influx of new players. It’s vital to ensure scalability as our games become popular.\n\n**WonderZone NFTs**\nMany of our players have been waiting anxiously for WonderZone NFTs, Diamond tipped Pickaxe, WonderGem Pickaxe and NFT fishing poles eventually. We will fast track the development of our proprietary NFTs once we acquire the necessary funding.\n\n**Shared meteors and meteor tiers**\nCurrently in WonderMine, players can’t see the meteors that other players are mining.  Shared meteors will be an additional class of meteor that can be seen by everyone in the scene. **This will introduce some interesting competition and collaboration into the game**. The shared meteors will be more rare and valuable in general, and require more than one person to mine them. These rare meteors might drop all over the park, so a valuable meteor could drop in a distant place in the park, and you will have to gather people from the mining field to help you mine it, and you will all share the rewards!\n\n**Kingfisher social fishing game**\nSome of you know that we already ran 2 beta tests of our newest game “Kingfisher”, which is a social fishing game. Kingfisher will be integrated into the WonderZone crafting economy. The materials you fish will be used in combination with WonderMine materials to craft wearables in the future. Some of the funding will go towards bug fixing and improving it so we can finally release it in 2022!\n\nKingfisher playthrough by Peanutbutta:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj436P3ohCU\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n**The team**\n\n*   **Rob Dixon (Radix)**, Co-founder, lead developer\n*   **Chestnutbruze**, Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **Lew** Co-founder, 3D artist\n*   **maruudn** Community manager\n*   **Maricela Perdomo (Maricela)** 3D artist\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n**2022 Q1**\n\n*   Server improvements\n*   WonderZone NFTs\n*   Shared meteors\n*   New wearables\n*   Aesthetic improvement of in-game assets\n*   In-game highscore leaderboards with monthly rewards/tournaments\n\n**2022 Q2**\n\n*   Release Kingfisher, a new social fishing game\n*   More meteor tiers, rarer meteors with more valuable materials\n*   Wearables Shop and Ticket System\n*   In-game Pets\n*   More wearables\n*   Expand WonderMine to other scenes across Decentraland\n*   Restructuring of the park\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=90f57aa0-5908-11ec-9c52-0d9746a59174)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13771931,"end":1639670160,"start":1639065360,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x08530d1af564a20d44dcf1a6fe16145f06cf688ba18fdc3a942f6859473645a51047bcfbf3e5788839e03bb5edadb6898ab82b81a15a2d4b066c2b0f080064221c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":9028,"discourse_topic_id":3426,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmfel7s-expanding-and-improving-wonderzone","user":"0x91e222ed7598efbcfe7190481f2fd14897e168c8","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Expanding and improving WonderZone","description":"Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n**WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game** where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs.

Additionally, this space would function as a study environment and safe, social zone for intellectuals.

From the most remote corners of the word to new online societies, a main objective should be to spread knowledge and promote learning. Information should not be limited by language, location, or liquidity but rather compared, contrasted, and critiqued. In an era when information is at the tip of a finger, education must shift to a focus on verifying information, processing knowledge, and applying techniques to our lives. METAcademy would be a base for a variety of courses and classes for learners to pursue. From physical fitness and cooking to traditional English and mathematics, this new realm of education would offer learners revolutionized access to topics and concepts. Learners may enter METAcademy and select from a running list of subjects--some of which may take place on Jupiter or in ancient China. Let Shakespeare talk about his time or learn the Pythagorean Theorem from Pythagorus himself. Work completed within the METAcademy may be minted as NFTs for collectibles within Decentraland, with duplicates donated to the learning facility collections. Learners may utilize \"rooms\" within the METAcademy to study alone or with peers and participate in discussions. Enter the next generation of education and learn something new today!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nTo obtain the name \"METAcademy\" within decentraland, it would cost .007328 ETH. Also, the cheapest parcel of land currently listed for sale is located at -56, -133 for 3,450 ETH.  Alternatively, this design may work with other, more fiscal hosting options. A GoFundMe has also been created to promote donations from intellectuals hoping to secure a location for safe and limitless learning: https://gofund.me/d300c2e2 . This location would act as a host for the different classes offered by teacher users. Learners could assemble and select a class and teacher within the server to be relocated for sessions. Educators may utilize their Avatars to interact with students within Decentraland, list zoom links for online class learning, or use Google systems for materials, links, and videos. Several starter NFTs have already been minted for interaction including the building and emotes: 0xee8f3df7e0a66f2943133eb43dd29b354df060f9\nContracts for educators would include sections which agree to refrain from certain interactions and content. Educators would be independent contractors responsible for the materials, instruction, and feedback for learners.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI'm TeacherBr00ke (Brooke Cadieu) and I proposed this learning facility after discovering the new society of online users looking to shape the future. I graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with a degree in English education for grades 6-12. I received my teaching license from the state of Tennessee and educated in public schools in Chattanooga for several years. Within the brick-and-mortar classroom, I fostered relationships with students and experienced the difficulty of educating large groups of students in real time. Specifically, intrusions of personal space and bullying were common detractions from everyday learning. Further, I noticed a need for specified learning for students with varying interests and skills. This meant that the traditional path and curriculum was not benefitting every student equally. Thus, I realized that learning should be more flexible and interest-driven.\n\nI later switched my educating to online courses offered to students located in China. In these classrooms, students ages 3-15 would log on with a camera and microphone to learn English. With nearly a thousand students and over one-hundred thousand minutes taught online, I learned that every, single student has different needs. Samples of my online teaching can be viewed on Teacher Brooke YouTube. However, regulations in China prohibited the connection of servers from outside Mainland China to continue and I could no longer teach my students in this region.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nBeginning phases should be expected to take approximately three months to procure a location, mint features and emotes, enlist educators, enroll students, and advertise beginning courses. Within the first month, a location for the facility would purchased and design for its interior and grounds would begin. Also, infrastructure for learning environments would be established. By month two, advertisement for educators would begin with applications and contracts submitted for proposed learning topics. Contracts would be signed before educators could submit a course for review. Proposed courses would be reviewed before listed in the curriculum. Advertisements for student sign-ups would begin. By month three, preliminary courses would be offered within Decentraland for students. Over the remaining start-up time, additional courses and educators would be made available and feedback would refine courses for learners. Once the program is fully sufficient, works created within METAcademy will be featured in a collection for viewing, collecting, and showcasing the learning done within METAcademy.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=b15dc250-53c4-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13730100,"end":1639091220,"start":1638486420,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xa084c1e1fe3716264adaf51427eef91b14e8cd30028759d3f09716ef6adbe98f65f888af52dd331f564f87947a8132ecd5e6708795b48b07431038b0a6fc90871c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":8472,"discourse_topic_id":3215,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmbkuc1-education-everywhere-build-a-learning-center","user":"0x915aa85dc088ea2d5850d44f9a21c7bf388a9672","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Education Everywhere- Build a learning center","description":"Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a grant to purchase a plot of decentralized land on which to build a learning facility (\"METAcademy\") for seekers of knowledge, mentoring, and socialization with others.

It aims to enroll 100,000 DAO members within two years.\nDigiFun is dedicated to empowering the designers, modelers and participants involved in metaverse construction. Everyone with a creative idea can become metaverse planners and work together to build Decentraland's future. In addition, the flexibility of DigiFun governance enables the DigiFun community to adjust the DAO team framework to provide the digital entertainment services required by the metaverse based on real-world and emerging challenges.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x17A6ba0B9Cc209ec061BA117769Ec7e9a30A0952\n\n## Description\n\nAbout $5,000 is needed for the initial code development and website construction for DigiFun DAO, as well as marketing and publicity at the initial stage of the project. Among this, $3,500 will be used for technology development and $1,500 for marketing, publicity and giveaway to the community (to motivate the participants).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nDigiFunDAO will be deployed on the Polygon chain. There is no fixed number for the members of DigiFunDAO. The participants of DigiFunDAO will be divided into the following different groups with different roles. (Everyone can keep multiple identities)\n\n—DigiFun: Provides communication platform, financial support and support to creators;\n—Designers: Responsible for the appearance design for clothing, buildings or other Decentraland products;\n\n—Modelers: Complete the modeling work of the specific product based on the manuscript provided by the designers;\n\n—Advisers: Participate in the whole process of product design and development, providing suggestions for designers and modelers to adopt;\n\n—Proposers: DAO members can offer proposals for Decentraland's virtual works and the development of DigiFunDAO. Proposals can proceed to the formal stage after receiving enough votes during the presentation stage;\n\n—Decision makers: DigiFun product holders (POAP, clothing, etc.) can become decision makers. The official listing of products on self requires the votes by DAO members, and will be adopted only when a certain percentage of votes will be reached (also votes for a better product, letting everyone get involved in building a better future for DCL)\n\nSolutions for potential problems\n\n1.  When the DAO organization expands, if there is a conflict between the interests of some DAO members and the overall interests of the project (for example, PoW miners prevent PoS improvement), then it can be solved by POAP dividends/buyback or destruction to ensure that the overall benefits of the project can be returned to DAO in some way.\n2.  Regarding governance enthusiasm, we will motivate DAO members by airdropping NFT for the governance, but will not make promise to the encouragement, to avoid the phenomenon of click farming.\n3.

These will be led by doctors and consultants with particular expertise in that field. We aim for these events to be highly interactive and therefore highly valuable for the participants.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4748629B341aE21D5009Ae425DFa79e9Fd852282\n\n## Description\n\n\\*\\*\\* Please note this is a resubmission following our previous grant request and feedback from the community and developers. The overwhelming feedback was that this is a concept that will be highly valued and useful within the space, however, the focus should be to start smaller and grow based on the response from the community\n\nWe are therefore asking for a small grant initially to pilot the concept of a health education space, and run a small series of health education classes with a focus on some key health topics which will be of high value to the community.\n\nWhat we hope to achieve long term;\n\nSolving health inequalities;\n\n*   Access to expertise across several fields of medicine, psychiatry and surgery, who will provide health education to the users of Decentraland (no matter where in the world you are from) \n\nImproving health;\n\n*   Focussing on key health issues, we can aim to improve and empower users, through education, to make healthy choices and understand more about disease and medicine \n\nMental health support;\n\n*   With access to psychiatrists and psychologists, we will have a particular focus on mental health education and support. We know this is a key issue globally, and in particular amidst the global pandemic. \n\nCommunity driven;\n\n*   We want to ensure we are delivering and catering to the needs of the community. We will ensure that the direction of our educational events are driven by the community, and focussed on the areas that matter the most to you. \n\nHow we hope to achieve this;\n\n*    Weekly live educational events Each week there will be a doctor led event, where education on a particular health topic will be delivered to the community. These will be interactive, and include dedicated time for questions and answers.  \n*    Dedicated sessions on mental health Delivered by psychiatrists/psychologists, we will have sessions dedicated purely for mental health support and chats.  \n*    A list of trusted health professionals We will continue to build on our bank of trusted healthcare professionals, all of whom will be fully registered and indemnified by their national medical councils.\n\nThe future aims of the project;\nWe are hoping to expand our project to run virtual medical clinics for the users of Decentraland.

The historical data on group can be used to predict future outcomes of new patients with commonalities - which of course, would be confidential, encrypted and masked.\n\nTop Reasons People Do Not Go to Therapy:\n\"I'd rather talk to my friends.\"\n\"It costs too much.\"\n\"I don't have time.\"\n\"What good is talking going to do?\"\n\"Therapists don't say anything; they just sit there and judge you.\"\n\"Therapists don't really care about you; they do it for the money.\"\n\nDecentraland Behavioural Group Therapy rules includes:\n*   Maintain Confidentiality\n*   Commitment to Accountability\n*   Limiting Socializing with Group Members\n*   Communicate with Words, Not Actions\n*   Participation is optional","specification":"his research project will be carried out in three phases:\n* Phase 1: Data Collection.

This means  capturing a market while in its infancy. More users creating accounts to make purchases, or visit shops , and in return more impressions for other users and other projects on the Metaverse.\n\nAfrica's internet infrastructure is pretty much non existent, or very poor where it exists, we are happy to be one of the few companies building it. What this means for the young people doing business online, it is challenging, also for the few who have managed to conquer the internet they frequently face multiple roadblocks like nonexistent platform integration ie pay pal failure to integrate Mobile money though some progress has been made towards this end it has been long overdue. There is a nonexistent bridge between Credit cards a payment mode dominant in the west. This means restricted capital flows hence a problem resolved by digitizing the business premises  . Its worth noting credit and debit cards are NOT accepted by a large number of residents of the vast continent, but mobile is the dominant form of payment in the order of several fold. Bitsoko is Building its services around mobile money.\n\nWe intend to resolve this by allowing our merchants to sell their digital goods and services in the Metaverse thereby eliminating excessive bureaucracy and excessive red tape experienced during the business registration process experienced by many young entrepreneurs starting their entrepreneurship journey.\n\nCapturing the market potential of the Young African continent should be something Decentraland should be interested in. Not only will they visit our shops on the mataverse, they will also visit other locations on Decentraland implying  positive multiplier effects in terms of user visits and Platform adoption, I am sure they will be spending alot too.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe intend to hire more developers particularly to develop 3D models for the Metaverse. I believe we will have multiple integrations between the real world shops and those in the metaverse which can end up slowing you down.\n\nIts worth noting Bitsoko has a plot of land on Decentraland though not the desired size  check out.\nhttps://play.decentraland.org/?position=58,-125\n\nwe have also been creating content posted on our youtube, check out\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvwS_yLoa7E\n\nWithout a doubt we see the potential of the Metaverse.\nThanks to Bill and Melinda gates foundation, an angle investor does not require much from you, we have been working without any fixed deadlines on the project. This has not stopped us from seeing the project is a success, as we have partnered with other industry leaders including Solana, Algorand, wallet of satoshi, among many others still in the works.\n\nMore details about the project timeline check out our Whitepaper on our community page here.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf9Wj53U74oqfvWDa9JO-jejzIXabAle/view\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nWe are a large group of developers but principally led by the co-founders Gibson Juma and Allan Juma more about us check out the whitepaper on our website check out.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf9Wj53U74oqfvWDa9JO-jejzIXabAle/view\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nWe hope to be able to let our users buy and sell digital products and services within 1 year after we receive the grant, thereafter we hope to be able to enable our users sell other goods from the Metaverse using interrogations with google maps and Bluetooth beacons in physical shops in the real world over the next year. thanks to our Networking department Dooca check out https://gateway.bitsoko.org/dooca.html\n\nWe hope to report on a trimester basis every 4 months but its good to note we are in a third world country and most things do not run like in a first world country. We have no issue moving elsewhere as we have done during our many visits around the continent, and we have come to like it the way it is, as it has informed our product development heavily. We are developing a service to be used in a market which we already are already part of. Be that as it may, we are very young developers with  a vision for the continent and hope to bring the project to a successful end.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=5a7f2570-4931-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13645481,"end":1637928480,"start":1637323680,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xcba894ce0bcea4987a4455a962f5a95329b72d9600a71f3a58cbb26c50c5dd2b5fc9c1f574161eb835308cab56c8ae17737a1df3b7accd695affe5de6269f18a1b","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":7874,"discourse_topic_id":2964,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmyjrcs-bitsoko-merchants-shops-on-decentraland","user":"0xd51ea3dad67c86d4edd7403d3288c2217ae1d2b3","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Bitsoko Merchants shops on Decentraland","description":"Should the following Tier 6: up to $240,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nHello?\n\nI am Gibson Juma, i have been working in the Blockchain space for the last 6 years after winning a global grand challenges a few years ago for more details about the challenge, check out\nhttps://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/challenge/enable-universal-acceptance-mobile-money-payments-round-14\nWe have been working with merchants in Nairobi and its greater suburbs by developing Blockchain based solutions and helping small businesses go online.\\\nhttps://gateway.bitsoko.org/soko.html\nHaving said this, i have seen the benefits of digitizing business solutions and believe  Decentraland is the next frontier of doing business, because a digital the business environment will have greater customization hence streamline the business process\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n240,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xD51eA3DAD67C86D4Edd7403D3288C2217aE1D2b3\n\n## Description\n\nWe are targeting the African population who's  median age in  is 19.7years.

This means  capturing a market while in its infancy. More users creating accounts to make purchases, or visit shops , and in return more impressions for other users and other projects on the Metaverse. \n\nAfrica's internet infrastructure is pretty much non existent, or very poor where it exists, we are happy to be one of the few companies building it. What this means for the young people doing business online, it is challenging, also for the few who have managed to conquer the internet they frequently face multiple roadblocks like nonexistent platform integration ie pay pal failure to integrate Mobile money though some progress has been made towards this end it has been long overdue. There is a nonexistent bridge between Credit cards a payment mode dominant in the west. This means restricted capital flows hence a problem resolved by digitizing the business premises  . Its worth noting credit and debit cards are NOT accepted by a large number of residents of the vast continent, but mobile is the dominant form of payment in the order of several fold. Bitsoko is Building its services around mobile money.\n\nWe intend to resolve this by allowing our merchants to sell their digital goods and services in the Metaverse thereby eliminating excessive bureaucracy and excessive red tape experienced during the business registration process experienced by many young entrepreneurs starting their entrepreneurship journey.\n\nCapturing the market potential of the Young African continent should be something Decentraland should be interested in.

And recently we started to receive income from the in-game shop.\n\nSince we allowed users to claim wearables using in-game points, more than 500 wearables were distributed!\n\nNow that the core mechanics have proven to work we want to improve the experience to attract and retain even more users.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n120,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x60297Cfec1d6941510A4573d6eE994d1b69fa656\n\n## Description\n\nPlay to Earn is a key element to onboard and retain new users to Decentraland.\n\n**With Golfcraft we are set to build one of the top P2E experiences in Decentraland**, and creating a polished experience requires a vast amount of work and resources.\n\nMinigolf has some core advantages, it's easy to understand, and can be implemented in Decentraland keeping the game fair and difficult to bot.\n\nBut building this project is not an easy task, requiring game design, level design, UX, smart contract development, visual design (both 2D and 3D), system administration, security, community management, marketing, business infrastructure and more.\n\n**With this grant we will be able to focus on 3 key components of the game: visual quality, P2E economy and bug fixing.**\n\n*   To improve the visual quality we will be outsourcing the work to [Polygonal Mind](https://www.polygonalmind.com/), the renowned studio behind Cryptoavatars, Megacube and countless amazing buildings around Decentraland.\n\n*   We will expand the p2e economy by allowing players to craft their own golf courses, and obtain passive income from them.\n\n*   And we will work on refactoring the code of the game to fix current bugs and prevent future ones.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe use Colyseus to run the game logic on an authoritative server, running the physics simulation and game logic.

(1 month cliff) grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe are looking to create the world's first health education platform on the metaverse.\n\nLed by British doctors from a variety of health specialties (including general practitioners, medical physicians, orthopedics/sports medicine, ophthalmology and psychiatry), we want to empower Decentraland's users with education and support on a variety of health issues - with a particular focus on mental health.\n\nWe envisage to run live weekly educational events on current, important and community-chosen medical topics. These will be led by doctors and consultants with particular expertise in that field. We aim for these events to be highly interactive and therefore highly valuable for the participants.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n200,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x4748629B341aE21D5009Ae425DFa79e9Fd852282\n\n## Description\n\nWhat we hope to achieve;\n\nSolving health inequalities;\n\n*   Access to expertise across several fields of medicine, psychiatry and surgery, who will provide health education to the users of Decentraland (no matter where in the world you are from)\n\nImproving health;\n\n*   Focussing on key health issues, we can aim to improve and empower users, through education, to make healthy choices and understand more about disease and medicine\n\nMental health support;\n\n*   With access to psychiatrists and psychologists, we will have a particular focus on mental health education and support. We know this is a key issue globally, and in particular amidst the global pandemic.\n\nCommunity driven;\n\n*   We want to ensure we are delivering and catering to the needs of the community. We will ensure that the direction of our educational events are driven by the community, and focussed on the areas that matter the most to you.\n\nHow we hope to achieve this;\n\n*   Weekly live educational events\n    Each week there will be a doctor led event, where education on a particular health topic will be delivered to the community. These will be interactive, and include dedicated time for questions and answers.\n\n*   Dedicated sessions on mental health\n    Delivered by psychiatrists/psychologists, we will have sessions dedicated purely for mental health support and chats.\n\n*   A list of trusted health professionals\n    We will continue to build on our bank of trusted healthcare professionals, all of whom will be fully registered and indemnified by their national medical councils.\n\nThe future aims of the project;\n\nWe are hoping to expand our project to run virtual medical clinics for the users of Decentraland. This will mean that you can access a one on one appointment with a fully trained and indemnified doctor/nurse for health advice/management.\n\nThere are several legal and indemnity requirements that need to be addressed in order for this to become a reality, and we hope that these can be worked out sooner rather than later (watch this space!)... this will be a world's first in the Metaverse.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe are already in a unique position to access a wide number of leading experts in healthcare and medicine, to deliver excellent health education events.\n\nWith the funds raised from the grant, we will look to hire a programmer and developer to build and maintain a space within Decentraland to run our educational events.\n\nThe funds will also be utilised to pay for the health professionals time during the educational events. We envisage that this will cover weekly events across a one year time frame, after which we will seek additional investment to continue our work.\n\nAny surplus funds will be utilised to invest in the future of the project, in particular seeking appropriate legal advice, and building the necessary framework for building the World's first Metaverse virtual doctor clinics.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n*   Project Lead - Dr I Farooqi\n    UK based General Practitioner, qualified in 2014.

This module will be made available to the community to help build a repository of functional examples to act as a starting point for new developers and provide a fun game that can be freely implemented into existing land.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n1,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xC24789C6f165329290Ddd3fBEac3b6842a294003\n\n## Description\n\nDevelopers for Decentraland (DCL) a few start-points when first learning how to create scenes in DCL. New users can find some content on YouTube, read through the SDK, and even find a set of snippets that display core use-cases (animations, transactions, etc); but we currently lack a set of larger, accessible projects which can be studied. Land owners also lack an available set of easily installed scene games, which provide valuable content, without purchasing such content through development teams or external sites.\n\nThis development grant seeks to target these two problems by providing a:\n\n*   functional code-base that can be accessed by developers to further their understanding of DCL development\n\n*   playable scene preview that can be easily accessed to show new users a small portion of DCL's potential\n\n*   functional game that land owners can freely host on their land\n\nThis project is the first in a series I am planning on developing. I'm starting small, mostly board-games and old computer games, to create a start point for any new developer. However, I am aiming to implement larger projects such as tower defence and card games. By implementing these projects and providing them to the community we should be able to make things easier for new developers, stimulate land owners to develop their land with free modules, and attract new users!\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe core design factor here is ease-of-use. The program will be created using modular design and a heavy focus on implementing interfaces. This means developers will be able grasp the high-level concept of implementation (how all the pieces fit together) and how each function works  (what the individual pieces do). This also provides users a way to add this game to their scenes without needing to have an understanding of programming.\n\nCheckers will be the game that this module will be centred around. Using this module a user will be able to create any number of boards that will operate independent of one another across the hosting scene.

A preview scene will be hosted on Vercel, as a static webpage, so community members can view/play the game as they want.

I've been programming for over a decade, with a primary focus on gaming, and I'm currently employed as a software engineer (working mainly with C and Java). While I've only been developing in DCL for the past quarter of a year I have made good strides and am fully capable of implementing this project in the given time-frame. I've created several projects to learn the platform and have a good understanding of the development pipe-line.\n\nOne of the projects I've implemented and polished for DCL is Minesweeper, which is currently playable \\[here!] (https://vercel-minesweeper-showcase.vercel.app/)\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe current estimate for this project is two weeks. During the first week I will implement the functional code and provide a preview of the game scene. By the end of the second week I will have polished the code to maximize readability and optimized the scene to run efficiently. During this time the Git code-base will be made available and the playable preview will be hosted!\n\nThank you for your time,\nTheCryptoTrader69\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=f79cfc20-41fb-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13587278,"end":1637135880,"start":1636531080,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x4ea70c85b993328b9f525a5cd9ceb8e0267bcb66d9402a42f5f4676060a781f232871eafa1beb86c902aefa7094e035e85ac5297f8b99d065bf5328d6839068b1c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":7564,"discourse_topic_id":2854,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmqby4n-community-module-creation-checkers","user":"0xc24789c6f165329290ddd3fbeac3b6842a294003","type":"grant","status":"enacted","title":"Community Module Creation: Checkers","description":"Should the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Gaming category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nI am seeking funding for the development of the classic board-game 'Checkers.'

After the initial pioneering work, virtual worlds can be added to the system-of-systems, ever increasing the size of the would-be Metaverse. Several prototypes have already been created integrating disparate systems using IPSME. This proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with other platforms, **without** requiring massive re-engineering efforts from Decentraland. IPSME does not require Decentraland to conform to a third-party protocol or SDK; IPSME uses Decentraland's existing infrastructure.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n48,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x18871A5a5F729b1C1F1Bf62611773cC26b00c317\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal would enable the pioneering work to integrate Decentraland with 4 other systems. Rather than incur large re-engineering costs to have Decentraland conform to a particular Metaverse protocol, the integrations with the other systems will be created external to Decentraland's implementation via IPSME. This is contrary to the often peddled approach which requires integrated systems to adhere to and implement a particular protocol or SDK. When protocols in the integrated system of systems are updated, Decentraland is not required to update in order to keep participating in the Metaverse space. Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4.\n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services.\n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966\n\nAnd a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA\\&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\\&index=1\n\nOver the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\n\nThe integration of Minecraft and Doom.  https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/metaverse-doom3-minecraft-integration/\n\nAnd, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/\n\n### IPSME:\n\n*   Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards\n*   translations are external to the systems being integrated\n*   reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead\n*   reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear\n*   each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure\n*   ability to dynamically query the network for new services\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe aim of this proposal is a 6 to 12 month project.

After the rudimentary infrastructure is ready, integration will start with two virtual worlds. If this proposal is granted, Decentraland will be the first to be integrated. Thereafter, the other integrations will be made until all virtual worlds form the system-of-systems.\n\nAs visible on my YouTube channel, I regularly release videos on the progress of my work.

Normally, integrating 5 systems together would require an exponential `5(5-1)/2=` 10 integrations, but translations in IPSME are transitively applicable, reducing the number of integrations required to a linear `(5-1)=` 4. \n\nDecentraland can choose exactly what APIs it would like to share with the other systems, whether that be teleporting, asset sharing, profiles, etc. Components will be created that can run along side Decentraland, with Decentraland only being required to update when it wants to make use of or offer services. \n\nBy integrating with other systems, Decentraland can onboard new users and dynamically make use of services that the other platforms provide. Decentraland can also operate as a service provider for other systems as well. The entire integrated system-of-systems can develop organically.","specification":"The specification for IPSME is here: https://doi.org/10.1145/3458307.3460966  \n\nAnd a simple video introduction can be found here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvoeUydcInA&list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK&index=1\n\nOver the last 4 years, IPSME has been tested in several prototypes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc_eusB5Phcw8sZqLNdl3BwGqifK_HGPK\n\nThe integration of Minecraft and Doom.  https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/metaverse-doom3-minecraft-integration/\n\nAnd, the integration of 123 third-party Minecraft servers: https://kim.nevelsteen.com/project/mim-web-of-interconnected-block-worlds/\n\n\n### IPSME:\n- Doesn't avoid standards, but avoids the ***need*** for standards\n- translations are external to the systems being integrated\n- reduced costs: rather than bring down and re-engineer the system to adhere to a standard, external translations are dynamically updated instead\n- reduced complexity: translations can be used transitivity, reducing complexity from exponential to linear\n- each world gets to choose what they share by exposing APIs on their existing infrastructure\n- ability to dynamically query the network for new services","personnel":"The aim of this proposal is a 6 to 12 month project.

grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAtlas Corporation proposes to develop an open source dApp which is used to determine the total amount of primary and secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator.\n\nAt the beginning of September, the DAO voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from secondary wearables sales to the creators of the wearables. This grant proposal builds on the previously 'passed' poll to bring it to fruition.\n\nCurrently, the DAO Committee does not have a tool to calculate royalties due to each creator and the DAO dApps team is still in the planning and hiring phase. The royalty fees due to creators currently reside in the DAO committee wallet and should be redistributed to creators when the accounts payable is calculated.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xe64581f067cfdce58657e3c0f58175e638c30f2b\n\n## Description\n\nThe scope of this project is the development of a tool that allows the user to view all primary and secondary sales per item, per collection. \"Primary sales\" are indicated by the consumer minting the wearable through the store contract, and originates from the null address. “Secondary sales” are sales that have occurred on the Decentraland Marketplace, either via direct listing from the creator or listing by a consumer.\n\nAny user is able to access the dApp and view data by either Wearable Creator, Wearable Collection, or Wearable Item. Data is presented in an intuitive way such that selecting an item, collection, or creator results in a table with a complete list of all primary and  secondary sales and some basic analytics about the market of that selection.\n\nThe transaction table is viewable within the app and downloadable by a user in CSV format for submission to the wearables committee.\n\nThe transaction table of primary and secondary sales transactions includes the following information:\n\n*   Name of the wearable, collection, and creator\n*   Date and time the transaction occurred\n*   Addresses of the buyer and seller (or ENS address if applicable)\n*   Transaction amount and currency\n*   The transaction hash, with link to [Polyscan](https://polygonscan.com/)\n*   The 2.5% royalty calculation for the transaction\n\nMarket Analytics:\n\n*   Weekly sales comparison, primary and secondary\n*   Graph of cumulative primary sales over time, by item and Mana\n*   Graph of secondary sales, including number of items sold, average price, and volume\n\nAdditional market analytics may be added as a result of discovery sessions with wearables creators.\n\nThis application will be hosted on IPFS. We will purchase a domain, register it for 3 years, and forward it to IPFS as a convenience to users.\n\nThe application will be made open source using an MIT license and the git repo will be made public, allowing users to run the dApp locally.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe dApp will make use of the following technologies:\n\n*   Angular\n*   Angular Material\n*   Bootstrap\n*   IPFS\n*   The Graph\n*   Decentraland Catalyst Server\n*   Ethereum Naming Service\n\nThe preliminary work towards this goal surrounds the inspection of the current subgraph implementation for L2 wearables indexing. First, to confirm whats needed to extract the data from the subgraph in its current implementation. Second, to understand if there is significant value to be unlocked for the wearables creators as to justify the development of this tool for its immediate and future use, subsequently resulting in the submission, and resubmission, of this proposal.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nDevelopment will be led by howieDoin.dcl.eth and MorrisMustang.dcl.eth from Atlas Corporation.\n\nhowieDoin and MorrisMustang joined the Decentraland community in February this year. Their primary focuses are gathering data and creating analytics for the Decentraland ecosystem. You can check out some public examples at [Decentralandalytics App](https://app.decentralandalytics.com).\n\nOver the course of the year, the team has realized how important some of this data is to the community at large and this grant proposal is one of our efforts towards democratizing access.\n\nDisclosures: Atlas Corporation has not created any wearables to date and will not experience a material gain from the existence of this tool, outside of the grant funds allocated for development.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nDevelopment Sprint 1:\n\n*   Locate the data\n*   Program the extraction of the data\n*   Aggregate and transpose the data into its consumable form\n*   Conduct discovery interviews with prominent wearable creators to arrive at user stories which will inform the design of the front end dApp.\n\nDevelopment Sprint 2:\n\n*   Design and implement user interface to retrieve and render the primary and secondary sales data\n*   Publish dApp to IPFS and route DNS\n*   Publish git repo with local deployment instructions\n\nProgress updates will be published to the DAO channel in Discord.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=97eeea20-40b8-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13577065,"end":1636996980,"start":1636392180,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xe5554c86cf405d0b8103987f76cb8dca792ab9de0da67bc51f1ccdf990d11906206d4bfd1380394a58fbc49ccaa7e700898ae5c2f0a0f0085252dc7b40e676b21b","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":7434,"discourse_topic_id":2792,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmb9zva-develop-a-dcl-wearables-market-analysis-tool","user":"0x3fb38cee8d0ba7dcf59403a8c397626dc9c7a13b","type":"grant","status":"enacted","title":"Develop a DCL Wearables Market Analysis Tool","description":"Should the following Tier 3: up to $5,000 USD in MANA, 3 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAtlas Corporation proposes to develop an open source dApp which is used to determine the total amount of primary and secondary sales for each L2 wearable, wearable collection, and creator.\n\nAt the beginning of September, the DAO voted to redirect the 2.5% royalty fees from secondary wearables sales to the creators of the wearables.

The subreddit has almost 500k members and there have been over 100 books published covering Blender.\n\nAs a creator that's made virtual worlds and avatars across dozens of platforms (including Decentraland) I've used Blender for:\n\n- creating, fixing, and optimizing 3D models and avatars\n- converting between different 3D file formats (great glTF support)\n    - 20k meebits were made into usable avatar files using Blender\n- High quality renders, lightmapping, and animations\n- Exporting content directly to web based virual worlds\n\nFeatures include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.\n\nOne of the foundation's goals is \"to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core\".\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Foundation\n\nBlender is GPL licensed, ensuring that the code will be free as a public good for all time. It protects the developer and user community from malicious patents, hostile forks, lock-down attempts, bait-and-switch-to-closed. Other software that is GPL licensed include the Linux kernel and wordpress. [Learn more](https://www.blender.org/about/license/)\n\nIt'll be iconic for Decentraland to be the first crypto-native project to be a sponsor and have its logo displayed here next to tech giants like Google, Facebook, Apple, Unity, Epic, Nvidia, Steam, Microsoft, etc: https://i.imgur.com/oK3sIrw.png\n\nCosts for corporate gold (based on 11/3 MANA price of $2.88):\n\n~12,100 MANA per year\n~60.5k MANA for 5 years\n\nIt's ~ <1% of the MANA released (https://vesting.decentraland.org/#/0x7a3abf8897f31b56f09c6f69d074a393a905c1ac), a small cost to send a large industry message about where we stand on software freedom and the open metaverse. I think it's a smart PR move, like how Visa bought a Cryptopunk.\n\nBlender currently employs 26 full time employees, and 12 freelancers remotely. Unity has over 5000. We need more open source in gaming.\n\nLink: https://fund.blender.org/","specification":"This is a one time donation to Blender fund which in return will get the Decentraland Logo next to the likes of Google, Steam, Adobe, Microsoft, Activision, etc. I'll continue to advocate for public goods funding across the twittersphere to help ensure an open metaverse ecosystem thrives over the next decade.","personnel":"Blender Foundation info:\n\n- https://fund.blender.org/about/\n- https://www.blender.org/about/people/\n- https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/","roadmap":"Blender Foundation will actively reach out to Corporate members to discuss the bi-annual planning for grants and review past supported projects.\n\nhttps://fund.blender.org/corporate-memberships/","choices":["yes","no"]},"enacted":true,"enacted_description":null,"deleted":false,"start_at":"2021-11-03T21:17:00.940Z","finish_at":"2021-11-10T21:17:00.940Z","created_at":"2021-11-03T21:17:00.940Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T16:58:27.241Z","enacted_by":"0xfe91c0c482e09600f2d1dbca10fd705bc6de60bc","deleted_by":null,"required_to_pass":1000000,"passed_by":null,"passed_description":null,"rejected_by":null,"rejected_description":null,"vesting_address":null,"scores_total":3438622,"grant_category":"Platform Contributor","grant_tier":"Tier 6","grant_size":175000,"grant_beneficiary":"0x9De8991C56F622175274fb358f981AF6F903a799"},{"id":"8a36d4d0-3adf-11ec-be0c-afec86cba5e5","snapshot_id":"QmPPDUaLgnGK1Aj76T8qxoLEwrCh6MpEvK7FoL1A7VUaio","snapshot_space":"snapshot.dcl.eth","snapshot_proposal":{"name":"Part Time liaison","body":"> by 0x7a5e56c9fb159fe942c724d929016313628e5661 (NonFungibleDude)\n\nShould the following Tier 1: up to $1,500 USD in MANA, one-time payment grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe must retain these new users!\n\nThe amount of questions I have answered in genesis plaza has been staggering.

We are a virtual reality (VR) start-up in the medtech space, developing healthcare service offerings for the metaverse (www.visre.co). We were invited to present our solution at an upcoming medical conference called the Primary Care Grand Conference 2021 that focuses on innovations in health and wellness (URL: https://www.askdr.co/pcgc21-nov).\n\nWe request for funding to officially secure a feature of Decentraland at this conference and officially acknowledge its support, in order to screen its promotional videos. We hope the DAO agrees on the value of this opportunity for visibility to this specialised audience that could value-add to our metaverse experience in decentraland, and we hope to seek your support!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n2,800 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x006d559fc29090589d02fB71d4142aa58b030013\n\n## Description\n\nThe upcoming medical conference is called the Primary Care Grand Conference 2021 that focuses on innovations in digital health and wellness for which we have been invited to present our solution. This targets interested healthcare practitioners and innovators in the medtech space, with over 100 doctors pre-registered to date.\n\nWe requested to feature $MANA and Decentraland promotional videos in our presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmXrOTEmxg). However, as the feature of Decentraland in our presentation constitutes an \"advertisement\" we need to obtain an official sponsor status for Decentraland for us to go proceed. Other protocols that have similarly funded the conference and secured official sponsorship include Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN) featured in the conference portal accordingly: https://www.askdr.co/pcgc21-nov\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe requested to include Decentraland promotional videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6DUV19Ri\\_8) in our presentation due to our goal to offer our solution in the Decentraland Metaverse in future, after we complete our ongoing clinical validation studies.\n\nAn earlier user acceptance study by our partner doctors has been published is freely available for viewing and download at this link:  https://innovations.bmj.com/content/7/2/278\n\nOur free preview augmented reality (AR) mobile applications used in that study which educate about eye health and the importance of eye screening are also freely available on the app stores:\n\n*   apple:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eyecu/id1377613953\n*   android:\\\n    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visre.eyecufinal\\&hl=en_SG\\&gl=US\n\nOther than describing our solution, our intended presentation also introduces the professional audience to the concept of the metaverse and non-fungible tokens, as well as features Decentraland as the leading metaverse platform with an active community and track record of high profile events including the recent metaverse festival (https://themetaversefestival.io/).\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nOur team from VISRE will be working on this project, including our full-time lead software developer and chief technology officer (CTO) Wong Kang-An who will be presenting the solution and about Decentraland. He will be supported by the clinical lead Dr. Dinesh Gunasekeran in sharing about the clinical relevance of these applications.  \n\nFurther information about our backgrounds available at these links here:\n\n*   Wong Kang-An: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kang-an-wong-18b429119/\n*   Dr. Dinesh: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dineshvg\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nThe conference is upcoming on 20 November 2021 - we have already sought pre-approval from the conference organiser, and would be allowed to incorporate this feature of Decentraland as soon as the community votes in support (if of course, you decide to vote for us). We hope you agree on the potential value of potentially drawing these clinicians to have a presence and value-add in our Decentraland metaverse.

RPSBET has been a 5 year project for us, we’ve combined so many features into the platform to ensure we make a super efficient income x gaming engine that is product/market fit. These things include Player Vs. Player (Bankroll)—to allow 24 hour games to run, skilled-based games only—to give users full control and an exchange-like UI—for setting stop losses (auto-payouts). More features include a 'Kaiji' inspired NFT card game, where users can use their liquidity knowledge as their high-skill component. Preview a card here: https://bit.ly/3B8Cjek. The platform could integrate nicely with Decentraland and offer a more PVP experience.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xB8Cc65eF61cb183C671b33B40D5D544EaBCDcba6\n\n## Description\n\nWe aim to become the first Gambling-to-Earn Platform, a safe gambling space; using skilled-based games as way of increasing your control rate with lower risk than typical gambling. Help us have a truly decentralized experience by voting on our partnership with Decentraland.org.\n\nThe problem with High-Risk Gambling & creating Quick Cash:\n(1) Timely & Addictive in a bad way\n(2) Time != Increased Earnings (this is bad practice)\n\nThe solution to Gambling & Creating an Income —RPSBET;\n(1) RPS encourages users to stake (benefit from token taxes) their bets vs. just putting tokens 'on the line'\n(2) Player Vs. Player—Truly House-Free, Zero House Edge\n(3) Skilled-based—Higher Control Rate, No Random, Provably-Fair Algorithms (e.g. dice games)\n(4) Bankrolled Games w/ stop-loss capabilities—set up automatic games, run them 24 Hours.\n\nWe had 5 years of development and testing time, so we've had the time to test the theory and made improvements after 4 trials to reach what we think now is product/market fit, **just need that final stage of development paid for** (the integration)—but maybe this is a sign from Decentraland to pursue this partnership?\n\n*“Gamification participants score 14% higher in skill-based assessments”*\n\nWith RPSBET, we could ensure an ethical future for Decentraland or it could even work in favour with the traditional gambling games to attract a wider user base as we see RPSBET an ideal fit for the current selection of games. We're behind Decentraland's motive of 'Being the House' and have come up with our own unique casino-like games that you can test so far using PayPal or Login with Metamask to receive some free virtual money to play with (as we're still in Beta):\n\n**RPSBET.IO Games**\n\nRock Paper Scissors\nThis game is very simple: rock vs paper vs scissors. You can create a game and choose your\nchoice. If you join a game and for example you choose rock. Once you have chosen your bet, you place it and find out the outcome.\n\nBrain Game—\nBrain Game questions set to test your knowledge against other users. This mode allows you to set a high score which you want others to beat. When playing against this bet, your bet is then placed and you have to attempt the questions. If you are able to beat the high score then you take the pot.\n\nSpleesh—\nNumber guessing game with a growing pot. Aimed for long-term holds. Plenty of mind games involved when users Join as they go for cheaper guesses you could sweep them by choosing a higher, more expensive number. Don’t risk leaving your money in too long as they will eventually guess it! So be sure to set auto-payouts.\n\nMystery Box—\nA new and improved Deal or No Deal. Pick the right box and you could win up to 50x your buy-in. Massive gains to be made from this game.

Ultramono organises events dedicated to progressive, futuristic, fusion art and  electronic  dance music, digital permaculture, inspiring conversations, and presents a gallery and clubbing events. Events are online and live, with documentation and exhibitions that can be accessed later, and usually with multiple participants collaborating in real time.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xa0d258e7895096f813dacdaa4cdc5bf4fddd4847\n\n## Description\n\nFlowershop is a cross between a gallery, club and a concept store. The idea of the flower shop that is so much more than the ordinary flower store comes from the cult Italian comic book Alan Ford by Bax Munker and Magnus. Flowershop is run by Ultramono, an art laboratory for the production of cybernetic art. Founded by Tanja Vujinovic (www.tanjav.art), new media artist with more than 25 years of experience in production and execution of multimedia events, Flowershop is going to be a new location and  continuation of Ultramono events organized across the Metaverse, that were recently held among other platforms also on VRChat and Sansar. It is envisioned as an online venue for live cyber exhibitions, performances and other events to showcase the work of artists and scientists before an international audience that will innovatively involve blockchain platform to support both community at large and participants. Using poaps, tickets, wearables, works of art, and creating workplaces, Flowershop will expand the ecosystem of the emerging new economy in art production within Decentraland.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nProject will be executed in stages, first being the actual building of the venue. Models of the building already exist, so this is going to be a process of optimization and adjusting the initial sketch so it can be fully functional on Decentraland platform. After the initial stage of building and setting up the base, we will start with developing individual modules and governance of the Flowershop, and work on a multiyear programme of exhibition, party, and conversations programme, and define curated and conceptualized exhibitions. We plan to have up to ten curated collective and individual exhibition per year, and monthly talks and party events, with spontaneous events as well. We are going to use this grant to hire stuff for curation and organization, get help in building and optimization, promote and network not just on the Internet but also using real life media outlets like for example Flash Art, and try to get in touch with art bloggers. Most important aspect of the whole Part of the grant will be used to get the land for the venue. Flowershop concept is the idea of self sustainability, so extra special attention will be devoted to having help with facilitating the financial management of the space so both the programme will continue and all involved could receive compensation for their contribution to the programme.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nUltramono is founded by a new media artist Tanja Vujinovic (https://www.tanjav.art/) who has produced and participated in hundreds of IRL and online events in the field of arts and culture. As a highly experienced world builder, an artist , PhD holder in the field of Media arts and philosophy but also curator and event manager, she has presented her works on numerous festivals, in galleries and museum across the world, and recently Metaverse.  The whole team and the structure of the Ultramono LABS is visible on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/dqVXsRr\nBesides already existing team members, we plan to hire few more people who are \"natives\" in Decentraland, mostly for consultations and to initially help facilitate community aspect of the space and establish good monetary practices for all involved and our future audience.\nFlowershop is the latest iteration that spawn from our success in organizing events in VRChat and Sansar, with the idea of making our permanent base in Decentraland and securing our financial sustainability across the Metaverse by making Decentraland our permanent and central home base.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nProgress will be reported on a weekly bases in writing and on our Flowershop community meetup every Saturday at 21:00 CET at our location, in front of everyone interested to hear about the development. Execution of all tasks described in the project proposal will start immediately as our initial funding is secured. Project is expected to be fully executed within three months, with our first public event expected to happen in January 2021. In the meantime, we are starting our with promotion campaign of the whole Flowershop as a cross between a gallery, a club and a concept store on all social media and within our already existing networks, so we could get as much support as possible.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=84c9c400-2dc7-11ec-ac84-77607720a240)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":13423287,"end":1634914320,"start":1634309520,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x37c3258797c379357d9810171f9ca308e0e4716c53afe1e777eceb16bbc5eddf70bce5b3b43d67ab3833ce559e96d7b80c62d45c749e2554d8ed712bd62c67241c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":6250,"discourse_topic_id":2414,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmxisac-flowershop-by-ultramono-labs-gallery-club-concept-store","user":"0xa0d258e7895096f813dacdaa4cdc5bf4fddd4847","type":"grant","status":"enacted","title":"Flowershop by Ultramono LABS (Gallery / Club / Concept Store)","description":"Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Content Creator category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nFlowershop is an Ultramono LABS embassy, for hosting our gallery, concert, and performance events.

Let’s show them Decentraland and help them understand what makes it a very special place and help them create vibrant and supportive communities within the DCL landscape!  No one wants a cash grab, and I can provide a guided program of enlightenment into DCL!\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x78a6C93cE98DBDBD4EC0D1f6Db17DE9a6A4Ae96E\n\n## Description\n\nINTRO: We are currently experiencing a flood of creators, brands and celebrities express interest in NFT's and all things Metaverse,  including fashion creators but also big brands and other industries.  We know many want to enter the space- I am here to ensure they are expertly guided keeping DCL community values in mind at all times with the goal of providing an amazing value-added experience for their fans and supporters as well as our beloved community.  Many do not know the first clue of how to begin and I receive messages regularly on all platforms that ask the question, can you help me??   I would like to solve this problem by providing an on-boarding experience that is easy to understand, exciting as well as tailored for them and enlightening in terms of what the community of DCL will respond to and embrace.  Let’s create a space to showcase talent, encourage collaboration with the DCL community and feature any artist who is interested in putting their work in front of these high - profile entities, whether it be a celebrity, brand or influencer.\n\nDEEPER DIVE: High-profile creators, celebrities and brands are coming, it’s just a matter of time.  I am committed to easing the friction and helping on-board high profile creators in fashion, or other industries, brands, boutiques, celebrities, you name it, while always keeping in the forefront the values and sense of community that is Decentraland.   I also want to encourage the creation of wearables for women in DCL!

$5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe BEN Decentraland Intercollegiate Meta-Delegate is an initiative to enable students from any and all universities to participate in Decentraland governance. During our meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing Decentraland proposals. Afterwards, students from every university in our network get to vote on the proposal, and the BEN meta-delegate casts its official vote in the direction of the majority. This way, BEN can bring representation and engagement from smaller universities who may not have the time, experience, or resources to operate their own delegates.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621\n\n## Description\n\nBEN has done a lot of collaborations with Decentraland in the past. We’ve hosted several workshops with 50+ attendees in partnership with Decentraland University inside their Crypto College campus, including with Polygon, Gitcoin, and Uniswap. Our leadership team and students also own MANA and LAND that they’ve delegated to BEN for some voting power and for land to build BEN's virtual academic headquarters.\n\nBEN currently runs meta-delegates across Uniswap, Compound, Gitcoin, Ampleforth, and Aave. Through the BEN Decentraland Meta-Delegate, our hope is to engage students and professors from universities all around the world with Decentraland governance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nWe started with a discussion group on the BEN Learn for the Decentraland Meta-Delegate. We collected interest from our students across various universities and various countries and hosted some virtual events in Decentraland. We also already hosted our first internal poll for our meta-delegate to get thoughts and consensus from our students on the recent proposal on whether wearables should count for voting power.\n\nOur next steps are to accrue voting power from our students, alumni, and community supporters that own MANA and LAND for the Meta-Delegate. That way, it becomes more attractive for students to participate.\n\nAs an example, we recently were one of the grantees for the Aave Grants DAO as well as receiving 2.5m in UNI voting power to use for our Uniswap meta-delegate per a16z. Since then, BEN’s Uniswap Meta-Delegate has gone on to participate in the currently active Arbitrum deployment proposal. We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap voting portal according to the internal result. This initiative has not only showcased effective decentralized governance execution but also demonstrated how a community that rallies together can have their voice be heard hundredfold.\n\nWe also plan on hosting monthly events and workshops with our students to bring in and educate them about the different projects in the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nWe've currently been running such an event series with all the UGP grantees in the Uniswap ecosystem and have seen much success thus far.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nErick Pinos is the President of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN).

We’ve hosted several workshops with 50+ attendees in partnership with Decentraland University inside their Crypto College campus, including with Polygon, Gitcoin, and Uniswap.

We also already hosted our first internal poll for our meta-delegate to get thoughts and consensus from our students on the recent proposal on whether wearables should count for voting power.\n\nOur next steps are to accrue voting power from our students, alumni, and community supporters that own MANA and LAND for the Meta-Delegate. That way, it becomes more attractive for students to participate.\n\nAs an example, we recently were one of the grantees for the Aave Grants DAO as well as receiving 2.5m in UNI voting power to use for our Uniswap meta-delegate per a16z. Since then, BEN’s Uniswap Meta-Delegate has gone on to participate in the currently active Arbitrum deployment proposal. We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap voting portal according to the internal result. This initiative has not only showcased effective decentralized governance execution but also demonstrated how a community that rallies together can have their voice be heard hundredfold.\n\nWe also plan on hosting monthly events and workshops with our students to bring in and educate them about the different projects in the Decentraland ecosystem.\n\nWe've currently been running such an event series with all the UGP grantees in the Uniswap ecosystem and have seen much success thus far.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nErick Pinos is the President of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN).

We pushed an internal vote to over 40+ student representatives from various universities across the globe and then cast the official meta-delegate vote in the Uniswap voting portal according to the internal result.

During our meta-delegate meetings, students from around the globe come together to present, discuss, and debate new and existing Decentraland proposals. Afterwards, students from every university in our network get to vote on the proposal, and the BEN meta-delegate casts its official vote in the direction of the majority. This way, BEN can bring representation and engagement from smaller universities who may not have the time, experience, or resources to operate their own delegates.","category":"Community","tier":"Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff","size":5000,"beneficiary":"0x66Aa8Bee5366b6b48811AE0Dac9Fe5e1EEfE1621","description":"BEN has done a lot of collaborations with Decentraland in the past.

$5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe components of this idea is that it will boost commerce on Decentraland, raise brand awareness of the creators and their stores, and bring more attention to the platform for it's ingenuity and creative events. This will be an NFT rebate and referral voucher meant to incentivize players to purchase wearables from participating vendors as well as to share the rebate via referring a friend's wallet address, whereby the voucher then shows up in there wallet available to use on their first purchase. The voucher will become void if it is not used in a specified time frame. I will describe the model in more detail in the description field.\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8\n\n## Description\n\nThe Circulating Rebate/Referral voucher is an NFT voucher designed to allow the player to receive a 10% discount on their next NFT purchase after making an initial purchase at participating vendor's stores. After the voucher is redeemed for the discount, it may then be either voided by the qualifying player, or sent to a referral wallet address whereby the referral will then receive 10% off of their first purchase and will have the same option to void or refer the rebate after redeeming it. The players referring the rebate will then have their name entered into the decentraland data base to participate on the next series of what I am calling the \"Perpetual Gratuity Week\" should their referral redeem their rebate. In this manner, the participating vendors will see a boost in their sales, the players will be given an incentive to purchase new wearables and items, the platform will be lively with activity and buzz, the players will enjoy the appearance of fresh new items to enjoy when engaging on Decentraland, and the word will get out that Decentraland is the place to be for fun events that reward creators and players alike. This can be further illustrated by wrapping up the week with a ceremonial event to reward the vendor that sells the most items with an NFT trophy and to award the player with the most qualified referrals with a free NFT item from one of the participating store's promotional items. This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\nThe best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\nI will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=93194990-eddf-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":12900387,"end":1627887780,"start":1627282980,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}},{"name":"delegation","params":{"symbol":"VP (delegated)","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"NAMES","address":"0x2a187453064356c898cae034eaed119e1663acb8","multiplier":100}}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0xd827cfece26c0332f5c30286cbfe3631ae08484be07c61c82c8be0947ae5bd5442a0e10603fa24dbcd264ff023c44bed4b09823a905530eec09ca5c388909f551b","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":3826,"discourse_topic_id":1617,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmvswaa-the-circulating-rebate-referral-voucher-and-perpetual-gratuity-week","user":"0xefd13f676744a527b1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"The Circulating Rebate/Referral Voucher and Perpetual Gratuity Week","description":"Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Community category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe components of this idea is that it will boost commerce on Decentraland, raise brand awareness of the creators and their stores, and bring more attention to the platform for it's ingenuity and creative events.

This should be a quarterly event so as to keep the platform appealing to players and creators and to allure new players and vendors with opportunity and excitement.\n          The best way to help fund this would be for the Decentraland DAO to use portions of the sales fees collected from participating vendors sales and from the publishing fees of those same vendors that mint their NFT items. Early registration of vendors would be necessary and the allocation of a portion of those fees into the event fund would be necessary to bring this proposal to event-ready status. Advertising the event and the participating vendors and any other sponsors should be done on the many billboards across Decentraland, and the fees for that should be calculated and charged when the participating vendors register for the event. The voucher will be minted in accordance with the exact number of NFT items each participating vendor is registering as available for purchase to the DAO as confirmation of the inventory count for the number of rebates that can be issued. The discord servers and social media should also be used to promote this event. The best way to describe this proposal is that it is incentivization via participation.","specification":"This is an NFT voucher to purchase NFT's from participating vendors, and to incentivize the purchaser to share the voucher via referring a friend's wallet, who will then have the same opportunity to redeem the voucher and refer a friend as well. I will use the grant to employ a programmer to write the code for this NFT and I will then issue it to the Decentraland DAO for them to mint the necessary amount of vouchers to equal the number of items each participating vendor is selling in this event.","personnel":"I work with only one designer and coder for these types of projects. We have done collaborations in the past and I am confident we will deliver on this proposal in a timely manner with ease. I am currently working with a freelancer named Anmol M. from freelancer . com. He and I have a great working relationship and he has really came through for me in the past.","roadmap":"I will only need two to three weeks to get this project done. The biggest barrier is that I will require the aid of the DAO in it's full implementation and event planning. If this barrier can be overcame, then I see this getting underway in a very brief time. I tend to drive the bottom line (respectfully) when it comes to deadlines and delivery. I treat those I am involved with in business with respect, appreciation and encouragement. I recognize that any goals worth achieving require the aid of the talented and the willing, and I invite those types to my circle to strive for achievement and to celebrate any success that follows. I am a bit of a visionary with enthusiasm to create and to build others up while doing so. I also believe in responsible capitalism and investing in others and their aims, should they be worthy of it. This is me, and this is my proposal, and I want to extend a big thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.","choices":["yes","no"]},"enacted":false,"enacted_description":null,"deleted":false,"start_at":"2021-07-26T07:03:00.633Z","finish_at":"2021-08-02T07:03:00.633Z","created_at":"2021-07-26T07:03:00.633Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T07:03:00.252Z","enacted_by":null,"deleted_by":null,"required_to_pass":1000000,"passed_by":null,"passed_description":null,"rejected_by":null,"rejected_description":null,"vesting_address":null,"scores_total":131205,"grant_category":"Community","grant_tier":"Tier 3","grant_size":5000,"grant_beneficiary":"0xeFd13F676744a527B1adce0b3c05834a54640ca8"},{"id":"33993260-ec0d-11eb-ba81-318d080cd8d0","snapshot_id":"QmRpzyGoT26YSfb3J181GyCBhDnhaWCNADwWbLsm9wVcWG","snapshot_space":"snapshot.dcl.eth","snapshot_proposal":{"name":"Is it possible to create marketing NFTs for content in decentraland like crowds?","body":"> by 0xe264886feb92e9c6a92fa196dfdc09d330b66c17\n\nShould the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs decentraland grows ever so quickly, a lot of content created is not seen or aware to users.

Currently, there are few guides that walk beginner content creators through a step-by-step process of how to model/upload/market their own wearables. I aim for my videos to help those new to 3D modeling mint their own wearables.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nOn Youtube I will launch a series of videos detailing the steps to modeling/uploading/marketing your own wearable. There will be a total of 6 videos to breakdown the process (2 videos per wearable modeled.) Example: Video 1 (Part 1) will detail the modeling of a wearable whilst Video 1 (Part 2) will detail the uploading/marketing of said wearable. I plan on modeling a shirt, a pair of pants, and will let viewers vote to decide the last item to be modeled. I will also give away 150 MANA at the end of each Part 2 video for viewers to put towards content creation or the purchase of wearables from the market.

City Planning is Toooooo Traditional for Metaverse\n\nMost of the city projects in Decentraland are similar to real life, which is extremely &ldquo;wired&ldquo; from our perspectives.

On the other hand, most city planning did not echo metaverse characteristics, including no-gravity, infinity light, and programming integration.\n\n2.  Virtual Cities are Difficult to maintain vitality\n\nThe vitality of the city needs user traffic. And the traffic of the city relies on the projects and activities inside. However, the current activities are too decentralized that make city hard to concentrate their users. It is very easy to see big cities with cool structures but have no constant user.\n\n3.  User-unfriendly in Short Distance travel\n\nTeleport functions make traditional long-distance vehicles meaningless, but people need to walk more enjoyable and efficiently in a short distance.

There are 254 smart items found in the Builder.  Some are +2 years old, most checked in and never touched again.  I will revisit all the smart items and add functionality where lacking.\n\nSummary of work:\n\n*   Add more dynamic functionality to a targeted subset of smart items: Trigger Type, Counter Type, Text Displaying Types, Toolbox\n*   Improve user feedback by adding enabling/disabling clickable + customizable hover text feature\n*   Make the smart item code more scene efficient by reducing re-creation of objects where not needed\n\n#### Demo / POC\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n5,000 USD\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74\n\n## Description\n\nFull Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/all-smart-items-prop.md\n\n### Adding more dynamic functionality for the very specific subset of smart items\n\n##### Trigger Types\n\nIncludes: Trigger Area, Trigger Round, Trigger Tile SciFi, Trigger Tile Square\n\nI want to upgrade the code to the trigger system code found https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-ecs-utils.   This upgrade will extend the current user entered/exited triggers.  It will add the ability to detect when objects interact with other objects and also define what objects can interact with other objects.  Interact here means when the bounds of 2 trigger boxes intersect with each other.  An example: Food is triggered (or eaten) by both cats or mice. Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n##### Text Displaying Types\n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.\n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.\n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n*   Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n*   Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n*   Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI already have one successful approved grant with delivered content. Below are the links to the previous grant, demo scene, and work delivered.  All of this proves I have the experience and skills required for working with smart items\n\n*   Past Grant: https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a.\n*   Demo: https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce\n*   Deliverables:  https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nScene here https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20\n\nYou can see my pull request to fix a bug found in the CyberPunk image cube item.\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Time to Complete\n\nI estimate roughly 10-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted, there are a lot of items to go through, 254 to be exact (and sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :).  Should the funding be approved I will start working and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Status / Progress Communication\n\nThe status will be communicated twice a month through this grant forum.   See \"Discuss in the Forum\" link.   I also have my github repo which will track progress\n\n*   Committed Code https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/\n*   Project Work: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/projects/1\n*   Status: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/wiki/Status:-Enhance-All-Builder-Smart-Items\n\n### Milestones\n\n*   Week 1-10 - Make smart items more scene efficient + Add more user feedback (Burn rate of ~25 a week)\n*   Week 1-2 - Trigger Types + Toolbox Bounce Action\n*   Week 2-3 - Counter types + Display Text types\n*   Week 4-6 - Making a Game Demo Scene using Triggers and Counters.  A smattering of other updated items\n\nWeek deliverables tentative but give general delivery order\\*\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ab782cf0-dace-11eb-9110-69b867ba991b)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":12745050,"end":1625791440,"start":1625186640,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x5a1c6a82869c7e0aefb3f103a6c753643ae3691427ec7adfca7d02c345820891409d026d933ec91a2efa4e812fb924b538209da8a5df55b62475de2f22f38f911c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":2871,"discourse_topic_id":1314,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmnydzq-enhance-all-builder-smart-items-feedback-cues-improve-triggers-counters-text","user":"0xbd5b79d53d75497673e699a571afa85492a2cc74","type":"grant","status":"rejected","title":"Enhance All Builder Smart Items Feedback Cues; Improve Triggers, Counters, Text","description":"Should the following Tier 3: up to a 3 month vesting contract of $3000 - $5000 USD in MANA, with a one month cliff grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\nEnhance Builder smart items enough so they are capable of creating scene-size dynamic games like Pong or Breakout.

Also, mice are eaten by cats, so a mouse's trigger area is triggered by only cats (not the food or other mice).\n\n##### Counter Types\n\nIncludes: Scoreboard, Countdown timers\n\nScoreboard for example, only when the target value is reached can it trigger an event.  Define more triggerable events as the counter is incremented or decremented.  Events such as trigger when increments by 1, nears the target value, reset etc..\n\n##### Text Displaying Types\n\nIncludes: Plain Text, Galleries\n\nBe able to change the text, font, color by an action event\n\n##### Toolbox Add Bounce Action\n\nToolbox currently manages object motion.  To be able to get dynamic movement more at least one more action needs to be added.  Bounce will take the current motion and calculate its bounce off an object/bounds.  It will calculate the most basic bounce trajectory of an object and purely reflect the direction.  It will not consider the object's mass, shape or rotation at the point of collision.  If it is possible to gain access to the object's shape and mass to determine a better angle and a more realistic bounce this will be a stretch goal.\n\nBounce will have a few parameters like \" elasticity\" or how bouncy the collision is.  It can either dampen the bounce or speed it up.\n\n### Make smart items more scene efficient.\n\n##### Add more user feedback\n\nThe user feedback on smart items is not very flexible or lacking (see General Audit provided below).   If they do have onClick events many times the hover text cannot be changed.  I want to add onClick events to more of the smart items as well as additional configuration abilities like changing the hover text.\n\n##### Some examples of better user feedback:\n\nThe Fantasy Black Button text says \"Press\" and cannot be changed to \"Press to open door\" for example.  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Blender smart item is clickable but the hover text is not changeable it just says \"Interact\".  Would it not be more fun if the hover text could be changed to \"Make smoothie\".  Or if the builder chooses not clickable at all that is not possible either.\n\nThe Trapdoor is not clickable nor has hover text.  While that is likely because it is supposed to be a secret trap door what if someone wants it to have this ability.  Make clickable with hover text \"Open secret door\"\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nYou can see the work I started here\n\nhttps://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/badd0bda-4f80-4372-af4d-092841097557\n\n### General Audit\n\nYou can see here an audit of all smart items and the features proposed to be added.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VB-4osSEVUW0AobdsLCokq-j6wCve9Aytam5wYyZlag/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n*   Name (Column B) gives the smart item name\n*   Existing Actions/Parameters (Columns C thru D)\n*   Audit of features existing or to be added (Columns G thru P)\n\nThis is a preliminary audit.  What features are listed in the audit document are subject to change.\n\n71 of the smart items (see General Audit provided above) do not reuse objects where possible.  Each instance of the same smart item re-creates the same object for each instance.  This directly impacts the weight smart items put on your scene when you add many of them.  It should be created once and reused instead.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here: https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip(s) that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so all these changes will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\nI already have one successful approved grant with delivered content.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.\n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in.\n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.  Categories will include areas such as Gaming, Content Development, Platform Development and Community Development.\n\nThis project will also aim to build academic interest.  By collecting and making data available for research purposes (such as the text transcription of all panel sessions) the project allows for spin-off data science studies.  For example, with the application of machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)) data scientists may analyse all the session's text transcriptions to perform topic classification.  Topic classification may be able to identify common points of interest and proposed solutions throughout the whole event.

By merging video conference calls with virtual world convention halls, stages and lecture theatres, this project will increase the intimacy of a virtual event in a new and entertaining environment.\n\nMany global events are now transitioning from physical conference halls to online video conference calls, but video calls fail to deliver the same atmosphere.  This project will showcase as a bridging platform to allow global events to transition to a more virtual environment that delivers opportunities that online video calls lack.  These opportunities include aspects like the ability to virtually meet up with friends between sessions, ability to move from one session to another halfway through, ability to see hot spots of participation and even allow the elderly, physically impaired and underprivileged communities to be involved in something that would otherwise be impossible for them to participate in.\n\nThe event will be hosted by Decentraland and run over 1 day in a format similar to a Pop Culture fandom based convention such as ComicCon (US) or SuperNova (AUS).  The day will consist of an opening plenary, multiple streams of parallel panel sessions, workshops and a closing plenary.  The streams of panel sessions will bring groups of panelists (2 to 5) together to discuss a single broadly defined topic from a list of categories.

Currently limited where only 1 action can be executed at a time move or rotate or scale.\n*   Scene Add/remove\n*   Attach/Detach Item\n\n### Demo / POC\n\n\\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\n\n## Grant size\n\n3,000 MANA\n\n## Beneficiary address\n\n0xbd5b79D53D75497673e699A571AFA85492a2cc74\n\n## Description\n\nFull Project Proposal Here https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce/blob/master/proposals/toolbox-ce.md\n\n### Actions To Be Added\n\n##### Face player\n\nThe target item will rotate towards the player at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.\n\n##### Face Item\n\nThe target item will rotate towards the target item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player\n\n##### Move to player\n\nThe target item will move towards the player who invoked it at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player\n\n##### Move to item\n\nThe target item will move towards the item at a configurable speed for how fast it rotates and stops when facing the player.\n\n##### Note on above\n\nAll of the above face/move actions will include lock X, Y, Z-axis which do as they suggest.  It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction).\n\n##### Follow Item Path\n\nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control\n\nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem)\n\nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\n\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.\n\n##### Scene Add/remove\n\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here\n\n\\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here \\[https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.\\\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27\n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.

Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a)**","choices":["yes","no"],"snapshot":12685474,"end":1624989180,"start":1624384380,"metadata":{"network":"1","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"symbol":"WMANA","address":"0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be","decimals":18}},{"name":"erc721-with-multiplier","params":{"symbol":"LAND","address":"0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"decentraland-estate-size","params":{"symbol":"ESTATE","address":"0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297","multiplier":2000}},{"name":"multichain","params":{"name":"multichain","graphs":{"137":"https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"},"symbol":"MANA","strategies":[{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","decimals":18},"network":"1"},{"name":"erc20-balance-of","params":{"address":"0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4","decimals":18},"network":"137"}]}}]}},"snapshot_signature":"0x81889a3b0257522f4c438341e159331ad3150eb6536d255e85aaffe7c60a7ec51ba612db7c2dfd139e53df75f536541691a8e80c08e19686c522d1e2f4c13dbd1c","snapshot_network":"1","discourse_id":2537,"discourse_topic_id":1194,"discourse_topic_slug":"dao-qmuqfxp-improving-the-toolbox-smart-item-in-builder","user":"0xbd5b79d53d75497673e699a571afa85492a2cc74","type":"grant","status":"enacted","title":"Improving the Toolbox Smart Item In Builder","description":"Should the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd more functionality to the toolbox smart item to enable users to make more dynamic scenes\n\nI will list the updates and then provide more detail below\n\n*   Add a set of \"Face Player/Item\" and \"Move to Player/Item\"\n*   Add \"Follow path\"\n*   Improve the  Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) to be able to run 1 move,1 rotate,1 scale concurrently.
